            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The firſt Particular is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the ſoule comes to bee one ſpirit with Chriſt. <hi>p. 25</hi> and this doth conſist in three concluſions. <hi>p. 26</hi>

                  <item>
                     <label>Concluſion 3</label>
The third concluſion is this, that the Spirit of grace in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe working thus upon the heart, it cauſeth the heart to cloſe with it in the promiſe. <hi>p. 33</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E told you that the application of the merits of Chriſt, conſiſts eſpecially in two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the preparation of the ſoule for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ingrafting or the knitting of the ſoule to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Of this preparation wee have heretofore largely treated: partly in contrition, where the ſoule is cut off from ſinne: partly in humiliation, whereby the ſoule is cut off from it ſelfe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord raſes the foundation of all carnall confidence, whereby a man reſts upon his owne privileges and performances, and makes his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices his Saviour; either the ſoule ſeeth no need to depart from ſinne, or elſe it thinke it can helpe it ſelfe out of ſinne: when both theſe are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4396:10"/>
from the ſoule, then it is fitted to receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſoule comes to be ingrafted into Chriſt: and that hath two parts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the calling of the ſinner; or the putting of the ſoule into Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the growing of the ſoule with Chriſt: theſe two take up the nature of ingrafting a ſinner into the ſtock:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is put into the ſtock.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, being put into the ſtock, it growes together with the ſtock: theſe two things are anſwerable in the ſoule. The former of theſe two wee have largely treated of, and fully finiſhed in the great worke of vocation, when the Lord brings the ſinner to himſelfe by the call of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and the voice of the Goſpell: we are now to proceed; and we have made ſome entrance into the ſecond; and that is the growing of the ſoule together with Chriſt: for though the graft be in the ſtock, yet it cannot be fruitfull, unleſſe it grow together with the ſtock: now this growing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is accompliſhed by two meanes:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the union which the ſoule hath with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is a conveyance of ſap, or ſweetneſſe, or a communion with Chriſt, and all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace and happineſſe that is in him: then to make up the growing together of the graft and the ſtock; Firſt, the graft is put into the ſtock. Secondly, there muſt bee a communicating of the moiſture that is in the ſtock, to the graft, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4396:10"/>
ſo they grow together; otherwayes it growes not at all, but withers away: now wee are firſt to deſcribe the nature of the worke in generall, and then we will deſcend to particulars, and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of it: now wee will define this union ſo farre as it concernes our purpoſe, not int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into particulars.</p>
                  <p>It is ſuch a joyning of the faithfull ſoule in ſuch a meanes to Chriſt, that it becomes one ſpirit: theſe are not by way of collection to be gathered, but they are plainly expreſſed in the text: and two points of doctrine I meane to proſecute: the firſt point is from the firſt part of the text.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label> Every true beleever is joyned unto Chriſts the word in the originall is, glued; he is glued, he is waxed, he is firmly and neerly combined and knit to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the deſcription, is the ſecond point in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> He is ſo joyned unto the Lord, that he becomes one ſpirit: as the adulterer and the adultereſſe is one fleſh; ſo he that beleeves in Chriſt, is ſo neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned to him, that he becomes one ſpirit: ſo we ſee the verſe offers two doctrines:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that a faithfull ſoule is firmly and neerly knit unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee is ſo knit that he becomes one ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>But firſt of the firſt doctrine.</p>
                  <p>What ever by way of compariſon can be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, concerning the neere combination of one thing with another, they are all tyed to this knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4396:11"/>
of the ſoule to Chriſt: looke what a friend is to a friend; looke what a father is to a childe; what a husband to a wife; looke what a graft is to a tree; and that is neerer than a husband to a wife: nay, goe yet farther, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.20. what the ſoule is to the body; the ſoule is not only knit to the body, as one member to another, as the hand is knit to the arme, and the arme to the ſhoulder; but the ſoule doth communicate it ſelfe univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally thorow the leaſt part of the body: ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is the very ſoule of a beleever, I live, yet not I, but the Lord Ieſus liveth in mee;</hi> ſo that looke as the body liveth by the ſoule, the ſoule cloſing, and communicating, and quickning of the ſame, ſo Chriſt is in a Chriſtian, and ſpeaks in a Chriſtian, and enableth a Chriſtian to the performance of that he doth; hence the body of the faithfull is called Chriſt, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12.12. but we will open this a little further in two paſſages:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the carriage of the ſoule in this cloſing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the manner how it doth cloſe.</p>
                  <p>The carriage wee ſhall deſire to diſcover in three particulars, which may bee expreſſed in a graft, when it is put into the ſtock: and I ſay, therein obſerve three particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is an exerciſe of the elements that are in the graft upon the ſtock, and are ſo farre mingled one with another, and doe ſo farre cloſe one with another, that they become one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the graft joynes to the ſtock, and none other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they doe not onely act thus, but are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4396:11"/>
bound one to another: and this makes them act anſwerably to theſe three particulars. There is alſo an expreſſion of the knitting of the ſoule to Chriſt in three particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ſoule gathers up it ſelfe, and all its ſpirits, its faculties, that doth exerciſe in the worke thereof upon Chriſt, and that makes the ſoule to grow unto the Lord: when the ſoule turnes the promiſe into good bloud, it doth not only chew the meat, but diſgeſt it, and it becomes good bloud: a true beleever gathers up all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of his ſoule, and imployes them upon Chriſt: hope expects Chriſt, and deſire longs for Chriſt, and love and joy imbrace Chriſt, and the will cloſeth Chriſt; thus the ſoule ſettles it ſelfe upon Chriſt, hoping, expecting, longing, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, loving, embracing: looke as it is with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that kneads dowgh, if there be two parts of it, the moulding and the kneading knits them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and makes them one lump: ſo there is the moulding of the ſoule to the promiſe, hoping, and deſiring, and longing, and chuſing; faith kneads all theſe together, and knits them unto God, and drawes the ſoule to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſoule is ſatisfied with Chriſt, and the riches of his grace; the beleever doth repoſe his confidence wholly thereupon: <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.19. that which makes the love of a husband increaſe towards his wife, is this, <hi>Hee is ſatisfied with her breaſts at all times, and then hee comes to bee raviſhed with her love:</hi> if a husband hath a looſe heart, and will not content himſelfe with the wife of his

youth, but hath his back doores, and his goings out; this makes a breach in matrimoniall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but when he is ſatisfied with her breſts, he is raviſhed with her love: ſo hope hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of mercy, and is ſatisfied therewith; deſire longs for mercy, and is ſatisfied therewith; the will cloſeth Chriſt, and it is fully ſatisfied with him; and if it were to chuſe againe, it would chuſe none but Chriſt: thus ſuck thou up the conſolations in the promiſe, and be ſatisfied therewith, and then thou wilt grow there upon; but if you will bee reſting here, and ſtaying upon the contentments of the world, this is weake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and drawes the ſoule from God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the laſt thing is the binding of the heart upon both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the keeping of the heart to the exerciſe of the promiſe, and to bee ſatisfied with the promiſe; 1 <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 23. <hi>If yee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the faith;</hi> being grounded and ſetled, ſo that a man doth ſtake downe his heart to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and holds hope, and deſire, and love, and joy, and the will unto it: it receives all Chriſt, and none but Chriſt, and ſtayes here, and continues here for ever: this ſame covenant that bindes the ſoule to Chriſt, is that which makes the union betweene Chriſt and the ſoule: thus we ſee how the ſoule carries it ſelfe in this union.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing conſiderable, is the manner how it is done, and the qualitie of this union: and this we will diſcover in three particulars;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is a reall union, but it is ſpirituall, you muſt not conceive it groſly, as if my body were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4396:13"/>
joyned to Chriſt; but there is a reall union which is ſpirituall: there is a union betweene the nature of Chriſt, God and man, and a true beleever: that which I deſire to declare is upon this ground, to difference this union from that which Divines are deceived in; viz. that it is an union more than it bare notion and apprehenſion of the minde; for what ever a man conceives, his underſtanding cloſeth with it; as whatever I apprehend, I cloſe with that; there is a conveyance of the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my minde, and I cloſe with it: now the union of a beleevers ſoule with Chriſt is more than this: it is not a bare apprehenſion, a wicked man will goe farre in the apprehenſion of Chriſt; but this union is ſomewhat more, and I call it a reall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe there is a knitting and a cloſing, not onely of the apprehenſion with a Saviour, but a cloſing of a ſoule with a Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay this is a totall union, the whole nature of a Saviour, and the whole nature of a beleever are knit together: firſt, that it is a reall union, all the places of Scripture doe intimate as much: what the branch is to the vine, the ſoule is to Chriſt: now they are more than imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo what the husband is to the wife, the ſoule is to Chriſt. Now they are more than in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; for a man may conceive of another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as well as of his wife; but this is another union, whereby the perſon of the one is knit unto another: the bond of matrimony knits theſe two together.

                  <p>Secondly, I ſay it is totall in ſo much that Chriſt is the head, and a beleever, a member; in both theſe regards they are joyned: Chriſt is the head of the Church, not onely according as he is God, but as hee is God and man; and a beleever is a member not onely according to his body, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his body and ſoule: now whole Chriſt being the head, and the whole beleever being a member, therefore a whole Chriſt, and a whole beleever muſt be joyned together.</p>
                  <p>The third is this, this union is inſeparable: <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> 32.40. <hi>The Lord promiſeth to make an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part away from them to doe them good:</hi> ſo <hi>Pſalme</hi> 89.33.34.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4396:14"/>
be, what ſhall it be, that can ſeparate a poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from Chriſt? if Satan could have hindered him from comming to a Saviour, hee would have then hindered him from comming to a Chriſt, when he had his greateſt dominion over him: if ſinne could have let him when a man had nothing elſe but ſin, he would not have forſaken that and have beene brought home to Chriſt. If the world could have prevailed, Chriſt ſhould never have pluckt him from it; but when Satan had his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt power over him, when a man was nothing elſe but ſinne by nature, when the world moſt prevailed, yet then God by his good Spirit pluckt thy heart from ſinne and ſelfe: that ſoule is mine, ſaith Chriſt, Satan muſt give way, and ſhall not hinder it: that ſoule is mine, ſaith Chriſt, ſinne ſhall not let it from comming to mee: that ſoule is mine, ſaith Chriſt, and the world ſhall not ſtop the worke of a Saviour; and if Satan in the height of his malice, and the world in the top of its force, could not prevaile to keepe the ſoule from Chriſt; then much leſſe ſhall theſe be able to pluck us from a Saviour: the point then is undeniable, that the ſoule is really, totally and inſeparably knit to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Concluſ. </seg>1</label> The firſt concluſion is this, know that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, the holy Ghoſt, the third Perſon in the glorious Trinitie, he doth really, and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably accompany the whole word: (that is the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4396:23"/>
generall) but he doth more ſpecially accompany the pretious promiſes of the Goſpell: the Spirit of the Lord is in theſe in a more ſpeciall manner, though he be a God every where in regard of his providence, yet hee is in a more ſpeciall manner going with, and accompanying of his Word; and in a more ſpeciall and particular fort hee is in the promiſes, the ſoule comes to bee one with Chriſt, and to bee knit unto him principally by the promiſe; the law prepares the ſoule, and the promiſe that calls the ſoule, and knits it unto Chriſt; God hath appointed his Word, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the promiſe for the converting of a ſinner; and therefore the Spirit of God goes therewith, and workes thereby, and gives a bleſſing thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, according as hee in his wiſedome thinkes fit: for he is a voluntary agent, and therefore may uſe the word as he will, and when hee will; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth alwayes worke in the word, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes after the ſame manner. You make nothing of the Goſpell, and of the Scripture; I tell you the Spirit of the Lord God, bleſſed for ever, is there after an extraordinary manner, and hardens the hearts of the reprobates, and humbles, and converts and comforts the ſoules of his ſervants: and when? not when I will, or you will, but when the Spirit of the Lord will. This is that I take to be the beſt expreſſion of it; looke as it was with the braſen Serpent ſet up in the wilderneſſe, there was an healing vertue inſeperably accompanying of that brazen Serpent; and it was as poſſible that hardnes ſhould be ſeparated from the braſſe,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4396:24"/>
as his healing vertue: for whoſoever lookt upon it, healing vertue did undoubtedly and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably goe with it, becauſe God had appointed this; therefore hee did bleſſe this, and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly worke by this: Juſt ſo it is with the good Word of the Lord; the Spirit of the Lord, though he be God every where, yet hee doth bleſſe this Word eſpecially, and goes with it, and hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it for the ſalvation of his ſervants: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the ſound comes to the eare, and the ſenſe to the minde, the Spirit goes with the Word when thou heareſt it, either to convert thee, or to confound thee: therefore the text ſaith, <hi>ye ſtiffe necked and hard hearted, ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> they would have pluckt Chriſt out of Heaven, and the Spirit and all. Now that this is a caſe undeniable, I prove it thus: that word which is able to diſcover the thoughts of the heart, and to raiſe the dead to life, and can comfort a diſtreſſed ſoule, and perſwade the ſoule of Gods everlaſting favour, that word muſt needs have a ſupernaturall power goe with it, for no created power can doe the former things: the Word tels the deepe things of God, the Word ſaith, I am ſanctified, therefore I am juſtified, therefore called, therefore elected: the Word reveals theſe deepe things of God, therefore the ſpirit muſt needs goe inſeparably with it: this is an undoubted concluſion.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Concluſ. </seg>2</label> The ſecond is this, and I take it to bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what difficult; the Spirit of grace, the holy Ghoſt, the third Perſon in Trinitie, working
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4396:24"/>
with and accompanying of the promiſe of grace and ſalvation; it doth therein and thereby leave a ſupernaturall dint and power, and a ſpirituall and overpowring vertue upon the ſoule, and thereby carries it, and brings it unto Chriſt, and there lieth a great weight, and obſerve it: The principall and efficient cauſe in the worke of the ſoule, to bring it to beleeving, it is not ſo much any thing in the ſoule, as a ſpirituall aſſiſting, and moving, and working upon the ſoule; by vertue of which working and motion it is moved and carried to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as thus: the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit let in a power to ſtirre hope, and it is ſtirred and moved; it lets in a power to quicken deſire, and it goes; it lets in a power to kindle love, and it flames; it lets in a power to perſwade the will, and it takes and chuſes: the Spirit moves upon theſe faculties, and by vertue thereof they are moved, and carried to the Lord: therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the maine principall cauſe of faith is rather an aſſiſting power working upon, than any inward principall put into the ſoule to worke of it ſelfe, but the worke is upon the ſoule: the ſoule by that power and aſſiſtance is conveyed and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home to Chriſt: obſerve it, I will expreſſe it in ſeverall paſſages, becauſe here lies the difficulty of the point.</p>

the creature out thereof:</hi> ſo it is with the Sip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (and when I ſpeake of the Spirit, I intend the promiſe too) the Spirit in the promiſe meeting with an humbled ſoule now abaſed, and ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and quarrelling with himſelfe, he is in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed eſtate, hee knowes not what to make of himſelfe, nor of his confuſed condition: now the good Spirit of the Lord moves upon the ſoule, and leaves a ſpirituall dint and ſupernaturall work upon it; and the ſoule by vertue thereof is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fitted, and faſhioned to goe to Chriſt: this I take to bee the meaning of that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 26, 18. Saint <hi>Paul was ſent to turne men from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light:</hi> Now it is a confeſſion amongſt all Proteſtant Divines, that the firſt ſtroke of the Spirit is upon the ſoule: there is nothing in the ſoule that can drive ſinne from the ſoule, and plucke the ſoule from ſinne; but the Spirit works this, and the ſoule takes this blow, and by vertue of that Spirit, the ſoule is pulled from corruption, and turned from ſinne: this is a confeſſed truth, that the firſt ſtroke in converſion is not from any thing within the ſoule, but it is from the Spirit; nay the ſame ſtroke doth two things; it turnes from darkneſſe to light: the ſame hand, and the ſame ſtroke doth both theſe; as for example, when you teare one thing from another, as you reare it from the other, you pull it to your ſelfe: he that puls a bough from a tree, as he pulls it from the tree, hee pluckes it to himſelfe: ſo the ſame Spirit that workes upon the ſoule in calling it from ſinne, it doth worke upon the ſoule in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4396:25"/>
it to Chriſt: it pulls off hope from the world, and makes it expect a Chriſt; it pulls off deſire from the world, and makes it long for Chriſt; it pulls off love from the world, and makes it entertaine a Chriſt; it pulls off the will from the world, and makes it chuſe a Chriſt; ſo that one ſtroke doth both, and it is plaine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worke of the Spirit upon the ſoule muſt bring it unto Chriſt. The like phraſe wee have, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.19. <hi>I have called you out of the world, therefore the world hates you:</hi> ſo that it is there the ſame voyce, the ſame ſpirit that calls a man from ſin; as that is not the way, thou poore ſinner, the way of pride and idleneſſe, &amp;c. that is not the way to Heaven. Now that call as it pulls the ſoule from ſinne, ſo that motion and moving, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall worke that it leaves upon the ſoule, the ſoule thereby being moved and drawne, it is comming to the Lord: the ſoule hath not ſo much the worke of the Spirit of grane in him, as the work of the ſpirit of grace working upon him, to draw him from evill, and to turne him to the Lord; and by vertue of the ſame worke hee is drawne from the one, and brought to the other: this I conceive to be the great difference between the union that <hi>Adam</hi> had with God, and that which the faithfull have. <hi>Adam</hi> had a ſtocke in his owne hand, God made him wiſe, and holy, and righteous; this was his ſtocke, he had a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within himſelfe, either to hang upon God, and ſo to bee ſuſtained, or to ſlide and withdraw himſelfe from God: he had power either to hold,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4396:26"/>
or to let goe: he had the ſtaffe in his owne hand, he might turne unto God, and cloſe with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand if he would, or he might depart from God, and withdraw himſelfe from the aſſiſtance which hee lent him as he did: but now here is a maine difference in the bringing of the heart home to Chriſt in this union, becauſe the firſt ſtroke that drawes the ſoule, and brings the ſoule to Chriſt, is not from any thing within, ſo much as from the ſpirit without: the hand of Chriſt it layes hold upon the heart, and workes upon the heart, and brings him home to himſelfe; this firſt ſtroke is from without, wee doe beleeve being fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereunto, and drawne by the Spirit of the Father; the everlaſting arme of the Lord that appeares in the Goſpell, hee lets it downe, and workes upon the ſoule, and brings the heart to himſelfe, and ſo the heart is brought to Chriſt, not from any Principle firſt in it ſelfe, but by the Spirit that workes upon it: when the Word of God comes to the ſoule, the Spirit of God accompanies that Word, and puls the earthly minde from earthlineſſe, and the uncleane heart from his luſts, and ſaith, Come out, thou poore ſoule, this is the way to a Chriſt that will pardon thee, this is the way to a Chriſt that will purge thee; ſo that my ſoule moves, but it is becauſe it is moved; my will clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, but it is becauſe it is perſwaded: ſo that the firſt ſtroke of this union is not from my ſelfe, but it comes from Chriſt; the hand of the Spirit layes hold on me, and drawes me to him: hence in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4396:26"/>
third place, the union drawes ſomewhat neerer; ſo that wee ſee, firſt there is a holy Ghoſt in the promiſe, and ſecondly, wee ſee that the Holy Ghoſt leaves a ſupernaturall worke upon the ſoule, and brings it home to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Concluſ. </seg>3</label> The third concluſion is this, the Spirit of grace in the promiſe working thus upon the heart, it cauſeth the heart to cloſe with it ſelfe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: the Spirit of God by the promiſe ſo works upon the ſoule, that it makes the ſoule cloſe with the promiſe, and with it ſelfe in the promiſe: and this is to be one Spirit, and this I take to bee the meaning of that place, <hi>Philippians</hi> 3.12. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he was apprehended of Chriſt,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I was not ſo much apprehending, as apprehended: not ſo much that he did it, but Chriſt in him, and upon him, and by him; for I told you the worke of the Lord in the worke of converſion, is upon us, by us, to bring us to himſelfe. The Spirit of the Lord is in heaven, and it is in the promiſe, and that Spirit in the promiſe comes to the ſoule of a beleever, and leaves a ſpirituall worke upon the ſoule of a beleever, and the ſoule is moved by vertue of that Spirit, to cloſe with that promiſe, and with that Spirit that is in the promiſe: I would expreſſe my ſelfe by theſe two compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; looke as it is with the moone, the naturall Philoſopher obſerves, that the ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſea, is by vertue of the moone, ſhe flings her beames into the ſea, and not being able to exhale as the ſunne doth, ſhee leaves them there, and goes away, and that drawes them, and when
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4396:27"/>
they grow wet, they returne backe againe; now the ſea ebs and flowes not from any principle in it ſelfe, but by vertue of the moone, being moved, it goes, being drawne, it comes; the moone ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting her beames upon the waters, it moves the ſea, and ſo drawes it ſelfe unto it ſelfe, and the ſea with it: ſo the heart of a poore creature, is like the water, unable to move towards heaven, but the Spirit of the Lord doth bring in its beames, and leaves a ſupernaturall vertue by them upon the ſoule, and thereby drawes it to it ſelfe: or looke as it is with a claſpe and a keeper; take a great claſpe, put it thorow the keeper, and being brought thorow, it cloſeth with it ſelfe: ſo it is with an humble broken heart, it is like this kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the good Spirit of the Lord is like this claſpe, the Spirit workes upon the ſoule, and leaves a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall vertue upon the ſoule, and goeth with that vertue, and puls the ſoule by the power of it ſelfe, and knits it to its ſelfe, it workes upon the heart in this manner, and claſps the humbled ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and brings him home, and holds him to the promiſe, and to it ſelfe in the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now I would contract theſe three concluſions, in the former ſermons, into three queſtions, to make them ſo familiar, that weake ones, which have any ſpirituall grace, may be able to come to aprehend and underſtand them:</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4396:29"/>
the members thereof, as the foot is knit to the leg, and the leg to the thigh, and the thigh to the body, and ſo to the head, this is the (meaning of that phraſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.56. our Saviour preſſeth this hard upon the Diſciples, and ſaith, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drinke indeed, hee that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and in him;</hi> then they begun to wonder at it, and to ſay, <hi>How can this be?</hi> and yet Chriſt ſaith, what if you ſee the the Sonne of man carrying the body of his fleſh into heaven, you will thinke it more hard to eat my fleſh then, yet you muſt eat my fleſh then too; how? <hi>it is the Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the fleſh profiteth nothing, the words that I ſpeak, they are Spirit and life;</hi> as if he had ſaid, my good Spirit is in the word and promiſe, cloſe you with my Spirit, and then you draw my Spirit, my fleſh and my blood downe into your whole natures; the words that I ſpeake, they are Spirit and Life; that is, my Spirit is in the Word of the promiſe, though my body be gone up into heaven; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cloſe you with my Spirit in the promiſe, and then you cloſe with my fleſh ſpiritually.

                  <p>Now for the order of this union how this is done, and there the queſtion will be this.</p>
                  <p>Whether the beleever is knit firſt to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt, or to the Divine nature.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 2</note> I am not greatly willing to meddle with this point in this popular congregation, becauſe there are many wiſe and orthodox Divines, and godly too, which are of contrary opinion; they confeſſe

both, but they differ about the order: but that I may bring no prejudice to the judgement of any, I will ſhortly ſhew you the ſumme of thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> which either ſide hold, and will ſhew to which I doe incline, and ſo leave the point to the judgement of thoſe that heare it, to incline to which ſide they thinke beſt, and thus I ſhall wrong none at all.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſome Divines, wiſe, holy, and orthodox, and many too, doe goe that way; all of them have it from that root: they that hold that the ſoule is knit to the humane nature of Chriſt firſt, have two reaſons for it.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If, ſay they, all the great works of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both ſanctification, and juſtification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, were wrought in the humane nature of Chriſt, and as by a channell conveyed to us by his humane nature, then it is reaſon that the ſoule ſhould firſt cloſe with the humane nature; but it is ſo that all the great workes of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſanctification, &amp;c. were all accompliſhed in the humane nature of Chriſt: for as the text
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4396:30"/>
ſaith, <hi>He died for our ſins, and triumphed over ſin, and hell, and death:</hi> therefore, ſay they, it is fit that the ſoule ſhould firſt cloſe with the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt; and this is the life and pith of all their arguments.</p>
                  <p>Againe, other Divines, and they are wiſe and orthodox, they hold this; and though all hold the maine ſubſtantiall truths of eternall life, yet they differ in this, they ſay the beleever is firſt knit to the Deity, and they have alſo two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the firſt is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That which is the maine and the proper object of faith, to that the ſoule firſt lookes, and to that the ſoule is firſt united: for all union comes by operation in this kinde, but the Godhead is the firſt object of faith in beleeving; the Godhead, and the third perſon of Trinity, they are the firſt objects of faith; therefore, ſay they, in the whole courſe of Scripture, faith is caſt upon the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.10. <hi>Who ſo is wiſe amongst you, that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voyce of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; he that walketh in darkneſſe and hath no light, let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon his God;</hi> all the phraſe of Scripture runs thus: <hi>Trust, and hope, and rely upon the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.1, 2. verſ. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, yee beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in mee:</hi> marke this Now did a man beleeve upon the Father, as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely, then hee did not beleeve upon the Sonne; or did he beleeve onely upon the Sonne, as Sonne, then he did not beleeve upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in that hee beleeves upon the Father
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4396:31"/>
and the Sonne: It is therefore plaine that he fals firſt upon the Godhead; and ſeeing it is ſo that wee muſt beleeve upon the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt; therefore we are not to beleeve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of them only, but upon the whole Deity and the divine nature, and all the three Perſons in the divine nature: for as the Schoolemen ſay, that which doth appertaine to this, as this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this and to none other. Now we beleeve in all the whole Trinitie, and therefore wee cloſe with all three, the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt: and hence it is that theſe Divines obſerve, that when we are ſaid to beleeve in the Scriptures, and in the promiſe (not that any doe it properly) but ſo farre as the promiſe that God in Chriſt, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and promiſing, and communicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: ſo farre we beleeve in the promiſe, that is, in his faithfulneſſe, truth and mercy, revealed in the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond reaſon which they alleage is this: ſay they, that which in reaſon muſt ſtay &amp; ſatisfie the ſoule of a beleever, it is that in reaſon to which the ſoule muſt firſt betake it ſelfe, and upon which it moſt firſt ſtay it ſelfe; for faith goes out for ſuccour, and for good: therefore, that which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can ſatisfie faith, to that onely it muſt firſt goe: the beleever is dead in ſinnes, becauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of them, but there is life in God: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to an infinite God the ſoule comes to worke an infinite ſatisfaction for him, which all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot doe in this caſe, the Godhead pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the humane nature, and workes by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4396:31"/>
nature, and gives power to the humane nature, and makes it able to ſuffer and to ſatisfie, faith ſees that he hath offended an infinite God, and deſerved puniſhment of an infinite value; therefore hee muſt repaire to him that can onely repaire in mercy to his ſoule: therefore ſaith the Prophet <hi>David, Pſalme</hi> 130.7. verſe, <hi>Hope in the Lord for ever, for with the Lord is plenteous redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and in <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.4. <hi>Truſt in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Iehovah, is everlaſting ſtrength;</hi> wee have everlaſting miſeries, and troubles, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, but with the Lord <hi>Iehovah is everlasting ſtrength,</hi> therefore <hi>truſt in him for ever:</hi> nay hence it is that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternall, that they know thee to bee the very God, and whom thou haſt ſent even Ieſou Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now if you aske me which of theſe judgements I follow; I anſwer, becauſe I love not to bee as a man that is here, and there, and no where in truth, but I love to bee as a man that dwels at home, for I am not ignorant that many Divines wiſe and learned, whoſe parts and gifts I reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, they follow the former opinions; and for my part I leave a judicious hearer to take which ſide he will; but in truth the two laſt arguments have prevailed with me, that the heart of a poor: ſinner beleeves, and ſtayes it ſelfe, firſtly, upon the Godhead, and Deity, and afterwards upon the Humanitie: and mee thinkes the two former arguments ſeeme not to compell any mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: for bee it granted, that the former Scriptures doe reveale the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4396:32"/>
mention him often as man, yet it is as true they reveale him to bee God, and mention his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, not mentioning at all his humanitie; but whenſoever they doe mention his humanitie, firſtly, it is for good reaſon, partly by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie to foretell of Chriſt, what hee ſhould be, and partly by way of ſtory and relation to relate of Chriſt what he was; yet this reaſon inferres not that faith muſt therefore firſtly lay hold upon the humanitie before the deitie; but when the Lord is pleaſed to reveale Jeſus Chriſt to the ſoule in the way of converſion, then wee muſt apprehend Chriſt, as God and Man in the point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and then let the queſtion be this: whither the ſoule ſhall goe for that which it wants? Now I ſee no reaſon why the ſoule ſhould firſtly goe to the humanity for what it wants and ſeekes: hence it is that when the Scripture comes to ſpeake in the way of converſion, the Godhead is ſet firſt: as in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe;</hi> as God in Chriſt reconciles the world unto himſelfe; ſo God reveales him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his faithfull Miniſters, and ſo they reveale him to the people; it was the Godhead that was offended, and muſt firſt of all be pleaſed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that God we muſt firſt goe for what we want; ſo <hi>Ieremy</hi> 33.16. <hi>In thoſe dayes Iudah ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Iſrael ſhall bee ſaved, and this is the Name whereby they ſhall call him the Lord our righteouſneſſe:</hi> ſo ſaid the Angell, <hi>they ſhall call his Name Emanuel, which is by interpretation, God with us:</hi> this is to the firſt reaſon; now to the ſecond argument I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4396:32"/>
anſwer thus; If it bee good in reaſon that wee muſt firſt goe to the humane nature for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons propounded, and if this be ſufficient to call my faith that way; becauſe all the great workes are wrought that way; then much more ſeeing the humane nature was inabled to the worke by the divine nature; therefore my faith muſt firſt looke that way, becauſe the weight of the worke lies upon the Deitie; the humane nature cannot aſſume to take to it ſelfe this glory, not bee any way available to ſatisfie divine juſtice, but that the Deitie enabled it, and therefore faith muſt firſt of all looke unto that. Thus it is confeſſed that the ſoule of a beleever is advanced to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous high privilege; now the uſe of it is referred to theſe three heads.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4396:39"/>
ſtock, but it muſt grow together with it, if ever there be any conveyance of any ſap, or any helpe and ſtrength, which it may receive from the ſame: ſo it is with the beleeving ſoule, faith doth not onely bring us unto Chriſt, but it makes us grow together with Chriſt: and this growing is diſcovered in two particulars;</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a ſpirituall union of the ſoule with our Saviour, when the ſoule comes to be united to, and made one with the Lord of life; that wee have alſo handled and concluded in the two laſt lectures.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the ſecond part that accompliſheth and makes up this growing together with Chriſt, it is that heavenly communion that the ſoule doth get with our Saviour, when the ſtock of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our Saviour, and the vertue of his grace is communicated to the ſoule; for this we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that theſe two things make up the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtock and the graft together:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there muſt be an union of the graft with the ſtock.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there muſt be an intercourſe or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the ſap in the ſtock to the graft: ſo it is with Chriſt, what ever he hath, he hath for his Church and people, and what ever he doth, he doth for his Church and ſervants; ſo that there is a kinde of conveyance of the vertue of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and power of his grace, unto the ſoules of thoſe that beleeve in him, and are knit unto him by a true and a lively faith: wee have done with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

now to ſpeake of the heavenly and ſpirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the intercourſe betweene the Lord and the ſoule, when the ſoule is married unto him; and this is that wee aime at, this is that wee looke at at this time; and this I muſt tell you by the way, that our purpoſe is not to meddle with the particulars at this time, but onely with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature of the communion of the ſoule with Chriſt: now for the diſcovery of this worke, wee have choſen the words of the text now read unto you, and the ſcope of the words it is mainly this; to diſcover unto us the dowrie and feofment of all that ſpirituall grace that is conveyed and made ſure to the beleeving ſoule, being made one with the Lord Jeſus: that looke as it is with a man that hath a faire eſtate to himſelfe, it is only his owne, but when the wife is wooed, and brought home, &amp; married, he gives over the right of himſelfe unto her, and if hee make over his eſtate unto her, ſhee hath title thereunto: this now is the dowry of a Chriſtian, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is no bad match, you muſt not thinke you could have done better; it is a wonder, that ever our Saviour would take us to himſelfe, or ſhew favour to us, but the caſe is cleare, if a beleever be called, and brought home to Chriſt, <hi>Chriſt is made to us wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and redemption;</hi> Chriſt hath all, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt hath, it is all yours, you have title thereunto, and ſhall receive ſap and benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, if you have hearts to take that good God offers, and you may receive: wee will not now
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4396:40"/>
meddle with the ſeverals in the verſe, but theſe two things muſt be ſpecially attended to in the words, that we may make way for our ſelves in the point we have to trade withall;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, take notice of the compaſſe of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſpirituall grace which God vouchſafeth unto his, and it is ranged into foure heads: the text ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is made unto us wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſanctification, and redemption;</hi> all that Chriſt hath or can communicate, all that the beleeving ſoule can deſire or want, may be referred to theſe foure:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> that is, the declaration of the way of God, and eternall happineſſe, in and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which all the policie of all cunning men, and all ſubtill pates in the world could never pry into, that wiſdome which revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſecret things, and the deepe things of God; the Lord Jeſus is made that wiſdome to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt is made unto us righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that is, whatſoever guilt lieth upon us, whatſoever ſinne hath beene committed by us, what ever puniſhment wee have deſerved, Chriſt is made unto us righteouſneſſe, to acquit us of all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt is made unto us ſanctification;</hi> the ſoule of a poore ſinner is defiled with many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and polluted with many diſtempers, now Chriſt is made unto him ſanctification, to purge and purifie him from all thoſe ſinnes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.</p>

the holy Apoſtle crowds in for a ſhare, and if wee looke into the 26, 27, 28. verſes, wee ſhall ſee to whom this belongs, <hi>Ye know your calling, brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mightie, not many noble are called, but God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe, and God hath choſen the weake things of the world, to confound the things that are mightie;</hi> why then to you fooles, why then to you weake things, <hi>Christ is made wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption;</hi> to you poore ones, to you weake ones Chriſt is made all this; nay, looke into the 28. verſe, <hi>God hath choſen the baſe things of the world, and the things that are deſpiſed;</hi> nay, and <hi>the things that are not, to bring to nought the things that are;</hi> that is to ſay, the off-ſcouring of the world, the ſcrapings, as I may ſo ſay: looke as a man flings away the ſcrapings of things as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, why ſo the parings of the world, you that are nothing in the eſteeme of the world, a company of poore baſe ſimplicians; <hi>Chriſt is made wiſdome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption</hi> to them; in a word then bee it knowne to every beleeving creature, though he have not a ſtrong faith, yet if he have but a true faith, to you Chriſt is made all that mercie and grace, that the word diſcovers, and the Lord hath purchaſed, and you need.</p>

we will adde ſomewhat alſo by way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to unfold the nature thereof, that wee may ſee what theſe invaluable treaſures are: for the proofe of the point, one or two places will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to caſt the caſe; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. there <hi>Paul</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God in Jeſus Chriſt, that hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt; ſo that there are bleſſings of three ſorts, all bleſſings, all ſpirituall bleſſings, all ſpirituall bleſſings in heavenly places, and all given freely, but it is in Chriſt, hee is the conduit that convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this, and wherein the ſtreames of life and grace flow amaine, to make glad the city of God, to make glad the Saints of God, and the ſoules of thoſe that beleeve in him; hence (it is remarkable <hi>Iude</hi> 2.) it is called, <hi>Common ſalvation by Christ;</hi> and ſo Chriſt is ſaid to be a common Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, not common to all the world, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beaſt may brouſe upon him, and ſinne, and have a Saviour to ſave him, but he is common to all the faithfull, common to all beleevers: that looke as it is in a common or forreſt, every dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and every inhabitant upon the common hath a ſhare therein, no man can challenge any part of the common peculiar to himſelfe, and ſay, This part is mine, and no man ſhall put any cattell here but I, but the common is every mans that dwels thereupon, and the pooreſt man may put on his cattell without controll, and drive his cattell whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he liſt, on to the beſt part thereof, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to his beſt benefit, without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſo Chriſt is a common Saviour, and the

richeſt mercies, and the preciouſeſt promiſes, and the greateſt grace and ſalvation that is in Chriſt Ieſus, every poore beleeving ſoule, thou art a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, and a borderer, and it is a common ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is a fountaine ſet open for Iudah and Ieruſalem to waſh in, thou maiſt take any, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive benefit from the greateſt and preciouſeſt promiſes that the word reveales, or thou ſtandeſt in need of; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. hee then ſaith, that God through his divine power hath given unto us all things belonging to life and godlineſſe, through the acknowledgement of him that hath called us to glory and vertue, what ever it is a man would have or can need, belonging to life or godlineſſe, hee hath given unto us all things through the acknowledgement of him that hath called us to glory and vertue; if thou canſt reſt upon Chriſt in beleeving, then God will give unto thee all things through Chriſt, belonging to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; ſo then we have the proofe of the point, by the joynt conſent of ſeverall Scriptures: now wee will adde a word or two by way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we may ſee the value of this dowry, that God hath promiſed, and will beſtow upon thoſe that love and feare his name: now for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the point, wee will doe theſe two things;</p>

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:4396:45"/>We will firſt begin with the former, wherein lieth the marrow and pith of the point: we have ſaid, that all bleſſings belonging to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, the common ſalvation of Chriſt, belongs to all beleevers, but how ſhall wee perceive this? how is this conveyed to thoſe that beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? now the tenure of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance diſcovers it ſelfe in ſeverall particulars, there are five or ſix of them in number:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, there is fully enough in the Lord Jeſus for every faithfull ſoule, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever grace, or whatever mercie hee ſhall ſtand in need of or want, there is no ſcarcity, there is no kinde of ſcantneſſe in the Lord Chriſt this way; in all other graces in this world, in all temporall things, when any eſtate is to be imparted, it is but in ſome particulars, either money muſt bee paid ſuch a day, or land muſt be poſſeſſed when ſuch a partie dies, but there was never any man could make ſuch tenure, as if a man ſhould make a feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his wife, of long life, and peace, and grace, and ſalvation, it is in no mans power to doe this; ſome men have a great deale of good things in this world, and many have little beſides; and againe, all men have not an all-ſufficiencie to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ſuccour a man according to all his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; but here is the excellencie of this dowry, that whatever it is the ſoule wants or ſtands in need of, the Lord hath it in himſelfe, and will communicate it to the ſoule for his good; <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.3. this is that the Apoſtle implies, <hi>In whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are all the treaſures of wiſdome and holineſſe;</hi>

Chriſt doth prevent this alſo; we may ſpend what we will, there is ſtill enough to ſpend upon; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>There are inſearchable riches in Christ;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, Thou knoweſt no end, thou findeſt no bottome of the vileneſſe of thy heart, that doth pollute thee and defile thee, why there is no end of the riches of Chriſt, no bottome of the Ocean ſea of Gods mercy, that may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee and releeve thee upon all occaſions; <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.34. the text ſaith, <hi>Christ received the Spirit above meaſure,</hi> as if Chriſt would prevent the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of a poore creature, and pluck up a diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged heart; when the ſinner thinks, my ſinnes are out of meaſure ſinfull, and my heart is out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hard; why thinke and remember, that in Chriſt there is mercy out of meaſure mercifull,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4396:46"/>
and grace out of meaſure powerfull, there thou ſhalt ſee bloudy <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> idolatrous <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> abominable <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> in the Lord Jeſus he hath received the pardon of all his ſinnes, and yet there is pardon enough for thee too: there thou ſhalt ſee <hi>Paul</hi> a perſecutor, and the bloudy jaylor; there is that power in the Lord Ieſus, that cruſhed the pride of the heart of <hi>Paul,</hi> and that brake the heart of the bloudy jaylor, that ſtood it out a long time, the earth ſhooke, and the priſon ſhooke, and the doores flew open, hee ſtood ſtill all this while, at laſt the Lord made him ſhake and all, as well as the earth; why, and yet there is power enough for thee too; in Chriſt there is fulneſſe without meaſure, take you may what you will, there is enough ſtill for all; <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1 laſt verſe, the text ſaith, that Chriſt is the head of all his church, and the church is his body, and what followeth? even <hi>The fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all things,</hi> that is, he fils all his ſervants with all that grace, and mercie, and compaſſion they need, ſo that there is a fulneſſe in the Lord Jeſus, and there is enough to ſupply all the wants of a beleeving creature, and to releeve him in regard of all thoſe neceſſities, that lye upon him; that is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as there is enough in Chriſt to ſupply all the wants of his Saints, ſo in the ſecond place Chriſt doth ſupply unto them whatever is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for them, there is enough for every Saint of God, and the Lord doth ſupply whatever is moſt fit for every man, whatever is moſt proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the need of a poore ſoule, and to the place

                     </gap>erable thereunto; I will open the point at large, becauſe it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what difficult; looke as it is with a wiſe father that hath a faire eſtate, and hath enough for his children, and thoſe that depend upon him, and is willing alſo to beſtow abundantly upon them according to their occaſions; this is the wiſdome of a wiſe father, he will ſtock his childe according to the calling wherein he is; ſo many hundreds will doe no more than ſerve one man in that place whereunto hee is called, whereas ſo many ſcores haply will ſerve another man; if one man hath leſſe, hee cannot trade; if another man hath more, hee cannot uſe it, hee hath more ſtock than he can employ; the merchant that ventures farre, hath great employments, many thouſands will ſcarce furniſh him: but a poore man, as a weaver, or a ſhoomaker, or the like, many thouſands are more than hee can uſe in his trade: againe, the wiſe father conſiders, if the childe bee a ſpend-thrift and in debt, there is more required to ſet up him, than him that is but now going into the world, or haply aforehand: ſo Chriſt as a wiſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deals with his faithfull ſervants, there are many of Gods faithfull ſervants, which are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſome to greater places in the Church, ſome in the commonwealth, ſome godly Magiſtrates, and religious Miniſters; now there is a great deale
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4396:47"/>
of wiſdome required for a Magiſtrate that ſtands in the face of the world, and in the mouth of the canon, to accompliſh great things for the glory of God, and the good of his Church; ſo a Miniſter, a little grace which is ſufficient to ſave a mans ſoule, is not enough for him to trade withall; ſome againe are leaders and commanders, as maſters of families; ſome againe are able Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which are fit to bee helpfull unto others; againe, ſome are caſt behinde hand in a Chriſtian courſe, who, before God opened their eyes, and diſcovered their ſinnes, and brought them home, they lived a riotous courſe, thoſe old arrerages of pride and looſneſſe many yeares together, a man is wonderfull in debt in this manner; now to bring home ſuch a ſinner, and to pardon ſuch a ſinner, and to ſanctifie ſuch a ſoule, there is a great deale of mercy required, and a great deale of grace required, there are many proud-hearted, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtout-hearted, as Beelzebub himſelfe, that take up armes againſt God himſelfe, and ſtand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance againſt the Lord of hoſts: now anſwerable to their conditions and corruptions, anſwerable to their debts and baſe courſes, when God will bring ſuch a creature home unto himſelfe, hee hath anſwerably ſtrange blowes for him; as it is ſaid of <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> the Lord humbled him mightily; ſo when the Lord comes to meet with an old looſe adulterer, and an old baſe drunkard, and a ſturdy perſecutor as <hi>Paul</hi> was, an ordinary ſtroke will not doe the worke, therefore as he had a great deale of mercy for <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo hee had a great

deale to doe before hee could humble <hi>Paul,</hi> hee flung him off his horſe, as he was poſting to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, and might have broken his neck: againe, men ſometimes are driven to great trials and ſtraights, as when God cals men to great trials and ſufferings; now God doth apply to every man, according to his eſtate and condition; he that God hath ſet as a commander in his Church, as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to teach, and a Magiſtrate to rule, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a family, Gods fits graces unto them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their eſtates, the Lord takes meaſure of a mans eſtate as it were, and ſuits him propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably with all graces neceſſary for his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: againe, they that are meaner and poorer, they ſhall have wiſdome, and ſanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but anſwerable to their conditions; that is obſervable, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Paul</hi> there calling our Saviour Chriſt the head of the Church, and his faithfull ſervants the members of this head, hee ſaith, <hi>By whom all the members being knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> according to their effectuall working in their meaſure they receive increaſe; as for example, in the body ſo much life and ſpirit, as belongs to the finger is in the finger, but there is more in the arme than in the finger, and more in the bulk of the body than in the arme, that which ſuits with ſuch a part, it hath it, and that which ſuits with ſuch a part, nature beſtowes it, there is not ſo much in the finger, as in the hand, nor ſo much in the hand, as in the arme, nor ſo much in the arme, as in the body, becauſe it is not ſutable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable; nature will not doe it, God will not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4396:48"/>
ſuffer it: ſo ſome Chriſtians are armes in the body of the Church, ſome fingers, ſome legs; ſome are ſtrong Chriſtians, that beare up a great weight in profeſſion, ſtout, and ſtrong, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and the like: now the Lord communicates all grace and mercy ſutable for every mans place and condition; thou that art a finger, ſhalt have ſo much grace as befits a finger; and thou that art an hand, thou ſhalt have ſo much grace as ſhall ſave thee, and is fit for thy place; but another is an arme, and hee ſhall have more, but all ſhall have that which is fitting; therefore the text ſaith, <hi>Christ is made unto us wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption;</hi> that looke as a man that makes a garment, hee takes meaſure of the man for whom he makes it, and fits every part accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the part of the body, the arme of the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet is ſutable to the arme of the body, and ſo Chriſt is made righteouſneſſe and ſanctification to all poore beleeving creatures; thou art an arme in the body of Chriſt, hee is made ſo much wiſdome and ſanctification to thee, as will ſerve thy turne; thou haſt had a great many ſinnes, and haſt beene a rioter and a roiſter before God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thine eyes, and brought thee home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: why, there is great mercy in Chriſt ſutable to thy ſinnes, there is mercy in Chriſt to juſtifie thee, if thou haſt never ſo few ſinnes, and there is mercy enough in Chriſt to juſtifie the greateſt ſinner, if hee can but beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and this is the ſecond paſſage in this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of agreement, in the tenure of the conveyance
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4396:48"/>
of grace from Chriſt to the ſoule: the Lord hath enough for all, and he doth communicate what is fit and proportionable to every mans eſtate and condition.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is this, as the Lord doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate what is fit, ſo he doth preſerve what hee doth beſtow and communicate, and give to the beleeving ſoule; hee doth not give grace to the beleeving ſoule, and there leave him, and let him manage his eſtate, but when hee hath wrought grace in the ſoule, he preſerves it, and nouriſheth his owne worke; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5. there the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and he maintaineth my lot;</hi> he doth not only give him his lot, but he maintaines his lot: it is a compariſon taken from the children of Iſrael, when they came into the land of Canaan, it was divided to every tribe by lot; now God did not onely bring them into the land, and give them their lot, but he maintained that lot, he defended them, and releeved them from the fury and rage of their adverſaries, that went about to take away that which God had beſtowed upon them; now the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The Lord is my portion, and hee maintaineth my lot;</hi> every beleeving ſoule hath a lot and portion in Chriſt, ſo much grace, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and ſo much aſſurance; now the Lord doth not onely give this, but when you are weake and feeble, the Lord keeps your grace, and preſerves your grace which hee hath beſtowed upon you; therefore Chriſt is ſaid to be the preſerver of his Church, <hi>Iude</hi> 1. <hi>To you that are called, and ſanctified,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4396:49"/>
preſerved by Ieſus Christ;</hi> Chriſt is not only the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of grace, but he is the preſerver of his Church, and that is the meaning of that phraſe, when our Saviour had implanted grace in the heart of <hi>Peter,</hi> he did not only plant it by his Spirit, but he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it by his prayers, that it might not wither away, <hi>I have prayed, that thy faith faile not,</hi> hee did not only give him faith, that was not enough, but he watered his faith by his prayers, that it might not wither, and dye, and decay; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. hence it is ſaid, that <hi>hee preſerves us by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation;</hi> and faith keeps the ſoule, and Chriſt keeps faith, faith is the hand that layes hold upon Chriſt, and Chriſt layes hold upon faith, and wee have a kingdome preſerved for us, and he preſerveth us for it, and this is the pith of that phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. the text ſaith, <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man is like the tree planted by the rivers ſide, that brings forth fruit in due ſeaſon, whoſe leafe ſhall not fade;</hi> he doth not ſay, his ſap ſhall not wither, but his leafe ſhall not wither, not onely that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſpoſition of heart which is wrought ſhall never decay in the Saints of God, but a zealous profeſſion ſhall never decay in concluſion; how ever a tree be nipt with the cold and froſt, yet in concluſion it will bud forth againe: ſo the ſap of grace that Chriſt workes in us, and conveyeth to us, being planted by the fountaine of the Lord Jeſus in the midſt of perſecution and fiery triall, they ſhall grow humble, and meeke, and holy in deſpight of what can befall them, for a Chriſtian is not conquered when hee loſeth his life, but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4396:49"/>
when he loſeth his grace; as take a man that is led into captivitie, into Turkie, into Algeir, or the like, the aime of him that takes him, is not to take away his life, but to make him deny his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and commander, and if hee can make him doe this, then he conquers him, but if hee dye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of the tyrant, if he be more able to ſtand for his commander and countrie, than he is to drive him from it, if he can beare miſery better than hee can inflict it, then hee is not conquered, but conquers; ſo it is here, a Saint of God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver maſtered, before his patience bee maſtered, and his holineſſe cruſhed; but when a man is more able to beare miſery, than the enemy to lay miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon him, if his patience hold, and his courage hold, and his uprightneſſe hold, he is not conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this caſe, but he is a conquerer: therefore the place is excellent, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.8. ſee how the Lord preſerves his people, hee is ſaid to be the whole army of his ſervants, (however there bee many ſtorms, yet the rivers of water make glad the people of God) the text ſaith, <hi>Thy righteouſneſſe ſhall goe before thee, and the glory of the Lord ſhall bee thy rearward;</hi> (when a man doth walke uprightly and ſincerly, wee muſt preſume, that a man is in a combat, for why doth hee ſpeake of the rearward elſe) there are two parts in a battell; firſt, the vant-gard, which is the former part of the battell; Secondly, the rear- ward, which is the hinder part of the battell; now Chriſt is both theſe, you ſhall have enemies before you in the vant-gard, and you ſhall have enemies behinde you to ſmite you in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4396:50"/>
the rear-ward, now righteouſneſſe ſhall goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, that is the vant-gard; and the glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rear-ward, that is, God is all about his ſervants, the vant-gard before them to ſuccour them, and the rear-ward behinde them to releeve them; ſo that he doth not onely give grace, but he maintaines and preſerves that grace he gives to the ſoules of his ſervants.</p>
                  <p>The fourth part of the tenure and conveyance of grace to the faithfull ſoule is this (and I ſpeake but only in the generall) the Lord doth not onely preſerve what grace hee gives, but hee quickens that grace he maintains, he drawes forth that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hee beſtowes, hee puts life unto that ſtrength and ſuccour which hee vouchſafeth to worke in the hearts of his children; hence all thoſe places are marvellous pregnant, God giveth the will and the deed, ſo that it is not onely the having, but the doing, that wee have need of from God; and <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth, that hee hath not onely grace from Chriſt, but he lives not, but Chriſt liveth in him, if Chriſt did all in him, and this is that wee ſhall obſerve, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. <hi>That hee would grant us,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>that being redeemed from the hand of our enemies, we might ſerve him without feare;</hi> take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two things here, Firſt, that the Saints of God are redeemed and juſtified by Chriſt, and now one would thinke a man that is juſtified, and hath Chriſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght trade for himſelfe, no, but that he would grant us, that being redeemed from the hand of our enemies, wee might ſerve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, it is one grant to be redeemed, and it
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4396:50"/>
is a new grant to ſerve him without feare; as it is a mercie for God to beſtow ability before wee have it, ſo it is a mercy to quicken that abilitie which hee vouchſafes, that wee may honour him by it, and he may honour himſelfe by us; therefore it is a moſt pregnant place, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. laſt verſe, when <hi>Paul</hi> was there labouring what hee could, yet as though hee had nothing, as though hee did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he gives all to God; for marke the manner of the ſenſe of the words, <hi>Whereunto,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I alſo labour and ſtrive;</hi> (the word in the originall ſignifies, I ſweat at it, and take great paines) <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his working, which worketh in me mightily; Paul</hi> laboured and ſtrived; but how comes this about? his ſtriving is by the working of Chriſt, and by his working he works; as who ſhould ſay, It is grace I have any grace, it is hee aſſiſting, it is he co-operating, it is he accompanying, (I know not what to ſay) it is his worke works, and hee works mightily in them that worke and ſtrive to advance the glory of God: ſo then we have thoſe foure particulars, that in reaſon almoſt might ſatisfie any man; what you want, Chriſt hath; what is fit, Chriſt will beſtow; if you cannot keepe it, hee will preſerve it for you; if you bee ſluggiſh, hee will quicken it in you; what would you have more? one would thinke this were enough, but that nothing might be wanting, take a paſſage or two more.</p>

                     <p>The firſt is this, there is a fulneſſe of all grace in Chriſt, whereby hee is able to ſupply whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is needfull to all thoſe that belong unto him; it is not with Chriſt as it was with <hi>Iſaac;</hi> when he had bleſſed <hi>Iacob, Eſau</hi> came and ſaid, <hi>haſt thou but one bleſſing my father, bleſſe mee, even mee alſo my father:</hi> no, there is enough in Chriſt for all beleevers: that mercy which pardoned <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> ſtubborne <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> idolatrous <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is ſtill with Chriſt; that mercy that broke the heart of the bloody Jailor, that ſtood it out to the laſt; the earth ſhooke, and the boults brake in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the priſon doores flew open, and yet the

what ever grace they want, and perfection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of what they have already, Chriſt is made all in all to his ſervants; why then away to the Lord Jeſus, if you will have any thing; hee cals and invites, <hi>Revelation</hi> 3. <hi>I counſell thee to buy of mee eye ſalve,</hi> if thou bee an accurſed man, buy of Chriſt juſtification; if thou bee a polluted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, buy of Chriſt ſanctification: <hi>I counſell thee to buy of me eye ſalve:</hi> there it is onely to bee had in that ſhop, therefore goe thither for it. It was the reſolution of the Prophet <hi>David, Pſalme</hi> 31. <hi>With thee is the well-ſpring of life, and in thy light ſhall wee onely ſee light:</hi> it is not here to bee had in your hearts, nor in your heads, nor in your performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor in the means themſelves, but with thee is the Well of life: yea, 'tis there, 'tis not here in our ſelves, 'tis onely in a Chriſt to bee found, onely from a Chriſt to bee fetched and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; improve all meanes, wee ſhould doe ſo; uſe all helps, we ought to doe ſo; but ſeeke to a Chriſt in the uſe of all, with him is the Well of life; but you will ſay, if Chriſt bee made unto us wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and redemption, why have not the Saints of God that grace they ſtand in need of, and thoſe inlargements, in prayer, and holy ſervices, which they crave and deſire? they ſeeke and have not, they pray and obtaine not; why the truth is, wee doe not goe to Chriſt for it, <hi>wee ſeeke for the living among the dead,</hi> wee never came where it grew, where it was made, your hand is in a wrong box, you are come to a wrong place, grace was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4396:62"/>
never made here. If a man ſhould come out of France, to buy ſilkes or velvets here in England, every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would tel him you are come to a wrong place for theſe commodities, they are not made here; if you would have broad cloth, and ſaies, here you may have; but as for ſilkes and velvets, they are not made here: ſo you would have grace out of the means of grace, why grace never grew there. The Sacrament ſaith, grace is not in mee; Prayer ſaith, grace is not in me; hearing ſaith, grace is not in me: we indeed convey grace, but it is not originally in us; Chriſt is the fountaine of grace, Chriſt is made unto us righteouſneſſe, Chriſt is made unto us ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe tell you wee have heard of the notice of grace, we have heard ſuch a rumour, ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that there is wiſedome, and there is grace, and there is mercy, and ſanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the truth of it is, it is not in us, it is in Chriſt onely to be had, hee is indeed made unto you righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification; goe then to him for it, and there you may receive it, this is the reaſon why that after the uſe of all meanes, after the improvement of all helps and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, our mindes are ſtill blinde, our hearts ſtill ſtupid, and the means prevaile not with us, worke not upon us for our good; we come to the Word, and returne as bad as ever, proud before, and proud ſtill; covetous before, and we are as cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ſtill, polluted and dead hearted before, wee remaine ſo ſtill, and continue ſo ſtill: why alas, grace originally was never made here, away to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4396:63"/>
Chriſt, hee is the ſhop from whence all grace is to bee had, wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe, and all is in him, there you muſt have it: but you will ſay, will Chriſt be made wiſedome to me that am ſo ignorant, to me that am ſo baſe? will Chriſt bee made ſanctification to mee that am ſo vile and ſo filthy? to mee that am ſo defiled and polluted? why, let this incourage you, hee is wiſedome to ſuch as are polluted, hee hath choſen the baſe things of the world, and the things that are not; <hi>hee came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> hee came not to call the wiſe, but the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to inlighten them; all that thou haſt to doe, is to take it, wiſedome is made for thee, and ſanctification is made for thee, and redemption is made for thee; if thou wilt but receive it, it is thine owne, it was made and ſit of purpoſe for thee: Looke as it is with a father, hee ſends his childe to the taylors ſhop, tels him the cloth is bought, the money paid, the ſuit made for him, onely bids him goe fetch it, and put it on: this is our folly, and it is our miſery alſo, wee either thinke to purchaſe or to coine grace out of our owne abilities; I tell you no, you muſt goe to the ſhop, it is bought and made already, onely put on wiſedome, and put on ſanctification, and it is yours.</p>
                     <p>Ah, but you will ſay, what is the reaſon if Chriſt have ſo much grace, that his ſervants have ſo little, if this bee ſo, why is it thus? As ſhee ſpake in another caſe, If the Lord be made wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the ſoules of his ſervants, if the Lord
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4396:63"/>
Ieſus bee made ſanctification to the ſoule of a poore ſinner; why are wee then ſuch fooles not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the wiſedome of Chriſt: why are wee ſuch polluted wretches after all the meanes of ſanctification vouchſafed to us: If Chriſt bee ſo rich, then what is the reaſon we goe ſo tattered, and are ſuch beggerly bancrouts in our Chriſtian courſe; ſuch beggerly prayers, ſuch beggerly duties, ſuch beggerly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, it is not becauſe Chriſt will not vouchſafe abundance of grace to us, hee offers it freely: <hi>Oh, every man that will, let him come and take freely of the water of the Well of life;</hi> not a ſpoonefull, but a whole bucket full, and that freely too, nay God hath bound himſelfe by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable oath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>that we might have ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> nay the Lord commands, in joynes his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>to abound yet more in wiſedome, yet more and more in patience, yet more and more in holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, againe I ſay, the fault is not in Chriſt, where is the fault then?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, it is in thine owne ſelfe-wild pride, and ſturdineſſe of heart, and haughtineſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; you thinke you are never well, but when you are complaining of your ſinnes, and quarrelling with your owne ſoules, your mindes are blinde, and your hearts are hard, and dead, and untoward, and therefore you fling away the promiſe, and caſt Gods kindneſſe into his face againe. I tell you it is horrible pride, becauſe wee cannot have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4396:64"/>
what wee would in our owne power, wee will not goe to Chriſt for a ſupply of what wee want; you complaine you want ſuch grace, and you are peſtered with ſuch corruptions, why thanke your proud venomous heart for it; if you have it not, if you want it ſtill, the fault is your owne, you will not repaire thither, whereunto you may have ſuccour and receive ſupply upon all occaſions; Chriſt would give it, but you will not beſtow the fetching of it; no matter therefore if you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtaine it.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay what courſe ſhall we take, what means ſhall we uſe to get theſe things at Chriſts hands?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, eye the promiſe dayly, and keepe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in view, within the ken of the ſoule (as we uſe to call it) be ſure the promiſe of grace never goe out of ſight of the ſoule. Looke as it is with a childe that travels to a Faire with his father, or goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a crowd, his eye is alwayes upon his father: he bids him doe not gaze about and loſe mee, the childe is carefull to keepe his father within ſight and view, and then if hee bee weake and weary, his father can take him by the hand, and lead him, or take him into his armes and carry him; or if there be any thing hee wants, or would have, his father can buy it for him, beſtow it upon him; but if the childe bee careleſſe and gazeth about this thing and that thing, and never lookes after his father; hee is gone one way, and his father another, he cannot tell where to finde him: whoſe fault is it now? it is not becauſe his father would
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4396:64"/>
not be within his ſight, or becauſe hee could not keepe within the view of him, but becauſe hee out of careleſneſſe loſt the ſight of his father: therefore hee ſure alwayes to eye the promiſe; you know, as long as the game is within ſight, the hounds run amaine; ſo I would have the ſoule make a prey of the promiſe: for ſo the phraſe is in the originall, that wee ſhould ſeeke the Lord, and hunt after Chriſt, and ſeeke the game it ſelfe, the promiſe it ſelfe, from day to day. It is the advice of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 50. <hi>Looke up unto me, all yee ends of the earth, looke up to mee, and your ſins ſhall be pardoned; looke up to mee, and your ſoules ſhall be ſaved; looke up to me, and you ſhall bee ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:</hi> It is not enough for a man to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit full of water, and to have the ſtreames run abundantly, continually, but he muſt put his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell under the ſpout, and then he ſhall bee ſure to receive abundance of water: ſo it is with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it is not enough to ſay, Chriſt is wiſedome, and Chriſt is righteouſneſſe, but it is not thus with my ſoule: why, put thy veſſell under the ſpout then, and looke up unto Chriſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. This is that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> reſolves of, <hi>I will lift up mine eyes to the mountaines, from whence commeth my helpe:</hi> what is meant by mountains there? you know the Temple upon the mount of Moriah; now in the Temple in Gods ordinance is Gods preſence: therefore ſaith the Prophet <hi>David, I will lift up mine eyes to thoſe mountains of mercie, thoſe everlaſting mercies; I will looke up to God in his Ordinances, from whence commeth all my help;</hi> as who

ſhould ſay grace comes not from a mans parts, grace comes not from a mans abilities, but looke up to God from whence it comes, looke to thoſe mountaines of mercy that will ſuccour you, look up to a Lord Jeſus that will ſupply all your wants, that will furniſh you with all grace, looke onely to him for all, for he onely is the Author and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all; looke as I have obſerved it, there is a fooliſh conceit that hath beene bred by ſome curious nice brains, that they have perſwaded themſelves they can make the Philoſophers ſtone, the nature of which is to turne all metall into gold, which is utterly impoſſible; for the Mines of gold are in the earth, and God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them by an ordinary courſe of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but all the men upon earth can never make gold by any Art or means in the world. To turne the nature of one metall into the nature of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is a kinde of creation, therefore beyond the reach of any man to doe it; they may trie and trie, and ſpend their heart blood and all, but it is all but loſt labour: So it is with our fooliſh blinde deluded hearts, and diſtracted ſpirits; we thinke to make gold, and to coine grace out of our owne powers, and parts, and abilities, I tell you, you can never doe it while the world ſtands; no, no, you doe but loſe your labour: goe to the Mine of gold, the Mine of grace, goe to the God of all mercy, away to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I ſay, he is made unto us wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and hee will informe us; hee is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us righteouſneſſe, and hee will acquit us;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4396:65"/>
hee is made unto us grace: goe to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and hee will communicate all grace unto our ſoules. Looke as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid to his ſonnes, when the famine was ſore in the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, hee ſent his ſonnes into Egypt to buy corne, that they and their little ones might not famiſh; and marke how hee calls upon them, <hi>Why ſtand you here gazing one upon another?</hi> I doubt not but then they were laying their heads together, and plotting and conferring, ſaying, the famine is great, and the times dangerous, and wee are miſerable now; but oh, what will become of us afterwards, if theſe times laſt? now the Lord help us, now the Lord bee mercifull to us and deliver us, what meanes ſhall wee uſe? what courſe were wee beſt to take?

my corruptions fierce, and my caſe heavie, that I know not almoſt what courſe to take; why ſtand you thus gazing after this faſhion? what, doe you thinke to get grace upon theſe termes, by diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and diſquieting your ſelves, and vexing your owne hearts thus? No, no, away to Egypt, to the promiſe of life, to the Lord Ieſus for help and aſſiſtance, and then you ſhall have mercy and grace abundantly beſtowed upon you, and that freely with your money in the mouth of your ſacks againe, you ſhall have grace that you need, and ſufficiently beſtowed upon you: Looke as it is with <hi>Eliah,</hi> when he was to depart from <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and bee taken up into Heaven, <hi>Eliſha</hi> craves one thing of him, and that was this, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.9. <hi>That the Spirit of Elias might he doubled upon Eliſha;</hi> now marke how <hi>Eliah</hi> anſwered; <hi>Thou haſt asked a hard thing,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>nevertheleſſe, if thou canſt ſee mee when I am taken from thee, it ſhall bee granted to thee.</hi>

requeſt ſhall be granted to thee; the collection is faire: ſo I ſay here, if thou wouldſt have a double portion of grace, doe not goe to prayer onely, doe not goe to hearing onely, doe not goe to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments onely and barely; but oh ſee a Chriſt, and looke upon a promiſe, and then thou ſhalt have a double portion of wiſedome to informe thee, a double portion of ſanctification to cleanſe thee, a double portion of grace, and power, and ſtrength, againſt thy corruptions, from Chriſt conveyed and communicated to thy ſoule: and this is the firſt rule.</p>

that this muſt or can be done, doe not thinke that you can maſter your owne corruptions, or that you can pull downe the diſtempers of your owne hearts, and get what grace you liſt; no, no, it is not your ſpirits can doe this, it muſt bee the Spirit of Chriſt, as by the Spirit of the Lord, ſo the Apoſtle. The phraſe of the Prophet <hi>David</hi> is ſweet in his kinde, <hi>Teach me the way unto thee;</hi> thy Spirit is good; as who ſhould ſay, O Lord, my ſpirit is a naughtie ſpirit; my ſpirit is a proud ſpirit; my ſpirit is a prophane ſpirit; my ſpirit is a weake ſpirit; my ſpirit is an ignorant and a blind ſpirit; but oh, thy Spirit is a good Spirit, thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a bleſſed Spirit: by the vertue of that Spirit, Lord, teach me the way to thee, and let it lead me into the land of uprightneſſe. We know, a child that hath his hand to write, if he will not be ruled by him that teacheth him, but will take the pen into his owne hand and write after his owne ſcau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching faſhion, he will never write well, nor make a letter handſomly as he ſhould do; but let his hand write by the mans hand, and that will guide him, and that will teach him quickly to write well in a ſhort time: ſo, wouldſt thou have thy heart fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aright? why then keep thy ſoule under the hand of the Spirit, and thou ſhalt bee guided by the vertue of that Spirit of God, and moved and inabled to accompliſh the good pleaſure of the Lord, and receive what ever grace thou ſtandeſt in need of.

                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:4396:68"/>This conveyance it is of two kindes, both in the Text: Chriſt conveyes his grace two wayes; partly by imputing, partly by imparting: they are the termes of Divines, and I know not how to expreſſe my ſelfe better; but thus if you will, partly by imputation, partly by communication: This is that I would have you to take notice of in the generall; they are both reall, but one is habituall; both theſe, both imputation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication expreſſe a reall worke of God upon the ſoule, but the laſt onely leaves a frame and a ſpirituall abilitie and qualitie in the ſoule; the conveyance by imputation doth not, it leaves a thing morall (as we uſe to terme it.) Theſe two, imputation, communication, are both in the Text; Chriſt is made righteouſneſſe, or juſtice, that is, hee doth juſtifie a ſinner by imputation, and hee doth ſanctifie and redeeme a ſinner by communication; hee conveyes and workes ſome Spirituall abilitie, and leaves a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call change; when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is made Iustice,</hi> that is, hee doth juſtifie a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by imputation, when hee ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is made Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> that is, by way of communication; hee delivers the ſoule from the pollution of ſinne, that is, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; hee delivers the ſoule from the power and dominion of ſinne, that is, redemption; This communication it is a Spirituall habit, or a ſpirituall power, or a ſpirituall qualitie or abilitie; (take which you will) left upon the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4396:69"/>
ſoule. We will begin with the former, touching the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe to a ſoule, whereby the ſinner comes to bee juſtified: this is a point then, which I take it, none more neceſſary, and yet none leſſe underſtood, none leſſe ſtudied, none more miſtaken than theſe two great workes of juſtification, and ſanctification. I ſpeake it by experience, Chriſtians aged and experienced, yet here they faile in the very cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheticall points, and it drives many of our beſt Divines to a ſtand; we will open it a little: this juſtification wee terme a conveyance of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, by way of imputation: but what is the meaning of this word, by way of imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Thus you muſt conceive it, this is the main thing I would have you looke unto; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is this, when that which another hath, that which another doth, is accounted mine, is ſet upon my ſcore as though I had it, as though I had done it, this is Imputation. I have it not, I doe it not, another hath it, another doth it, and it is accounted mine, and reckoned mine in courſe of juſtice. Now in the point of communication it is otherwiſe: becauſe I have ſomething, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wrought in mee, ſome qualities and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; for it is not a morall thing, but a phyſicall alteration by the power of grace implanted in me, which I have, ſo that imputation diſcovers two things. Firſt, that I have no help in my ſelfe in what I have, or what I doe. Secondly, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth that ſomething which another hath and doth, it is in concluſion made mine, and I have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4396:69"/>
the benefit thereof, as well as if I had it, as well as if I had done it. It is an old compariſon that Divines uſe, and there cannot bee a better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the full nature and the meaning of the point now in hand. Take a debtor now arreſted, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and he cannot pay the debt; another man comes, and will be his ſuretie: now marke this, another man payeth the money, another man ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth the creditor in the behalfe of the debtor; the creditor acquits this man, cancels all his bonds, lets him out of priſon, confeſſeth he hath nothing to ſay to him, nothing to charge him withall, he is fully ſatisfied, he hath given him full content: why the debtor paid no money to the creditor himſelfe, but becauſe the ſuretie paid it, therefore the payment is counted his, as if the debtor had paid it: this is the very nature of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. This I take to be the meaning of the firſt part of the Text, in which now a little I meane to trade: the Text ſaith, <hi>He is made unto is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> that is, God in Chriſt doth juſtifie a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever by way of imputation, though hee hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in himſelfe, though he doth nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe whereby to be juſtified in Gods account, yet God will juſtifie him through the Iuſtice of Chriſt imputed to him, and counted upon his ſcore: ſo that imputation implieth two things. Firſt, that a man hath nothing, can doe nothing. Secondly, that he is juſtified by ſomething, Chriſt hath, and hath done for him, the point then is cleare, and that is this.</p>

                        </label> God doth juſtifie a beleeving ſoule, not for what
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4396:70"/>
he hath, not for what hee doth but onely for what Chriſt hath, and hath done for him: I ſay Chriſt is made unto us Iuſtice, God the Father doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a beleever, onely in and through the merits of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>For the opening of the point, wee muſt firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what it is to juſtifie. Secondly, what doe we meane when as we ſay hee is made juſtice for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a man hath or doth. To juſtifie, in the phraſe of Scripture, it doth imply two things: Firſt to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, is to make a man juſt, and this is very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome uſed in Scripture: I meane thus to put ſome holineſſe, or ſome gracious diſpoſition, and ſome ſpirituall facultie and abilitie into the ſoule, and to make a man juſt: as when an ignorant man, is made a wiſe man; when a prophane man, is made a pure man; when an uncleane man, is made a righteous man, and ſo really changed: this I take to be the meaning of that place; <hi>Revelation</hi> 22.11. <hi>Hee that is just, let him be juſt ſtill; and hee that is unjuſt, let him bee unjuſt ſtill:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, when God hath beſtowed all meanes upon him, and vouchſafed all mercies and encouragements to him, if yet for all this hee will be unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill, let him bee for ever unjuſt: There is no hope of him, but hee that is holy, let him bee more holy, let him increaſe in grace, but wee doe not take it ſo now in this Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to juſtifie, it is a word of judiciall proceeding, when in a legall manner the Iudge doth pronounce a man free, and acquit him, and proclaime it as if he were, and ſaith the law hath
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4396:70"/>
nothing to doe with him, he doth pronounce hee hath not offended the Law: now this is oppoſite and contrary to condemnation, and this I take to be the meaning of that place, and it is a pregnant one; but this gives us great light and inſight into the place: <hi>he that juſtifieth the wicked and condemns the juſt, they are both an abomination to the Lord:</hi> to juſtifie in the former ſence, is to make a wicked man a good man; and is hee an abomination to the Lord? this were a groſſe folly: no, but the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is this: he that acquits any man as guiltleſſe that is guilty, this is an abomination to the Lord. Thus wee ſee the firſt word opened, ſo that when we ſay God doth juſtifie you, our meaning is not this, that God ſends grace or holineſſe into you, for this is the worke of ſanctification; but God doth juſtifie you, that is, hee doth pronounce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Tribunall, that his Iuſtice and Law is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied, that hee will lay nothing upon your ſcore, require no ſatisfaction at your hands, but he will fully and freely diſcharge you of all your ſins which you have committed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, againe, God doth juſtifie a poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not for any thing he hath not for any thing he doth: marke that, the meaning is this; no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege that a man doth enjoy, no part of wit, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or memory, or any thing that way: nay, I ſay more, there is no grace that a man hath, no dutie that he can performe, for which as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall and formall cauſe of our juſtification, God doth pronounce any man to bee righteous. If a man could weep out his eyes in ſorrow, if a man
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4396:71"/>
could hunger and thirſt for Chriſt, more than for his daily bread, God would not juſtifie a ſinner for all theſe things; how doth God then juſtifie a man? why he juſtifieth a ſinner, for what Chriſt hath done for him, the ſurety hath paid it, and he accounts it ours: a man is juſtified by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, not by any action: thoſe are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concomitants, not reall cauſes of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>But you will ſay, is not a man juſtified by faith, and is not faith a grace, and hath not a man that ability wrought in him by God.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, true the Lord doth juſtifie a man by his faith, but hee doth not juſtifie him for his faith; that is, faith is the hand that layes hold upon the obedience and merits of Chriſt, and it is for his merits, not for our faith, though by our faith wee are juſtified: a man lives by faith, not that faith nouriſheth him.</p>
                     <p>As we uſe to ſay, a man lives by his hands, not that his hands nouriſh him, but his hands labour, and his labour procures money, and his money provides meat, and by his meat he lives: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his hands are the means to get it, his hands are the means to obtaine it, therefore we ſay hee lives by his hands: Iuſt ſo it is here, a man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith in Chriſt, not that faith will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit any man under Heaven, but becauſe Chriſts merits are through faith received and applied to us, and ſo through Chriſt we are juſtified: ſo then wee heare the meaning of the point: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. marke the Apoſtles two phraſes, <hi>That I may bee
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4396:71"/>
found in him not having mine owne righteouſnes which is of the Law, but that which is of the righteouſneſſe of faith in Chriſt, which is of God by faith:</hi> there is but theſe two righteouſneſſes in the world. Firſt, a mans owne righteouſneſſe which hee hath wrought, and God hath given him, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he performes and this is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Law; now <hi>Paul</hi> doth profeſſe that he is not juſtified by this, but onely by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, that righteouſneſſe which is in Chriſt, that righteouſneſſe which is imputed to him from Chriſt, he labours to bee found in that righteouſneſſe, for by that he ſhall be juſtified.</p>
                     <p>The ground and reaſon of the point is this, that which in no meaſure is anſwerable to Gods Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and agreeable to the exactneſſe of the Law and for which a man may be condemned, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie a man; but what ever a man hath or doth, all the graces of God wrought in him, and all the performances done by him, there is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection or blemiſh even in them, for which God may juſtly condemne him: therefore a man cannot bee juſtified thereby: this is an undenied rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>what ever condemnes a man, cannot justifie a man, but the Law condemnes a man for what he hath or can doe:</hi> therefore it cannot juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a man. There is no grace in a man, no dutie to be performed by a man, but if God will looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it according to the ſtrictneſſe and exactneſſe of the Law, he may juſtly condemne him for it: that I prove, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. every Saint of God hath theſe two things, <hi>the Spirit luſting againſt the fleſh, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4396:72"/>
the fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit;</hi> and theſe two are contrary: In the beſt of Gods ſervants there is fleſh, and a luſt of the fleſh to hinder them from holy duties: ſo there are two lawes, the law of the minde, and the law of the members; the Law of God requires that a man ſhould bee perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any ſtaine of ſinne, perfect in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of dutie without any blemiſh or ſtaine therein, but every gracious man hath a ſtaine of pollution in his ſoule, that is one thing; and a ſtaine in his performances, that is another thing; therefore no mans dutie, no mans abilitie, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency cannot juſtifie him before God. It is that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> crieth out of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. <hi>A law in his members rebelling againſt the law of his minde;</hi> ſo that the caſe is cleare, if it were thus with holy <hi>Paul,</hi> as hee profeſſeth of himſelfe, then much more of the beſt Saints now, for that they have not more grace than <hi>Paul</hi> had: therefore they cannot bee juſtified for what they have or doe. Take a lame limme, as the lameneſſe of the legge will make every motion of the leg lame, a man cannot but goe lamely: ſo it is with the ſoule of a poore ſinner, when a man hath a lame heart, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſinfull heart, all his actions will bee lame, his thoughts lame, and his ſervices lame; ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart, nor life, nor actions, are in a right frame, all are impure and weake: I appeale to your owne conſciences in this caſe, would you be willing to appeare before Gods Tribunall with thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and thoſe performances of thine, and juſtifie thy ſelfe by them, and ſay, Lord thou canſt not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4396:72"/>
lay any thing to my charge, the Law of God can bring inditements enough againſt thee, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thee; nay, we condemne our ſelves in this caſe: theſe dead hearts, and theſe blinde minds, and this want of faith, ſhall the Lord then acquit any man for that which he condemnes himſelfe? If then the beſt and moſt gracious Saint hath ſin in the frame of his heart, and ſinne in the beſt of his ſervices, then neither ſoule nor ſervice can bee anſwerable to the Law of God, and he cannot bee juſtified thereby: but the beſt of Gods ſervants not only before grace, but after grace, in the beſt heart a man hath, the beſt action hee doth, there is weakneſſe in the action: therefore they cannot juſtifie a man, therefore we muſt be juſtified onely through the merits and obedience of Chriſt: thou canſt not doe, Chriſt hath done for thee; thou canſt not ſuffer, Chriſt hath ſuffered for thee; in him thou art juſtified, through him thou ſhalt be ſaved. So that when the ſoule of a poore ſinner, ſhall appeare before the Tribunall of the Lord, and juſtice comes to put in a plea againſt him, Chriſt ſhall ſtep in and ſay, Lord, for this poore ſoule that beleeves in me I have died: for this poore ſoule I tooke the nature of man upon me; therefore let thy juſtice bee fully ſatisfied with what I have done for him: well then ſaith juſtice, goe thy way, I have nothing to ſay to thee: the Lord makes a proclamation, Be it knowne to all men and angels, I acquit this ſoule; there is no imputation of ſin he hath committed, no failing in any dutie ſhall condemne him, this is the way of juſtification.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> Firſt, becauſe the Father was the party that was properly offended: the Father is the firſt perſon in the Trinitie, and he was directly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne; it is true, the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt were offended too, as being friends with the Father, and having a relation to the Father, and a ſweet fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but the ſinne was directly againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and indirectly againſt the Son, and the holy Ghoſt. The grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the point is this, it wronged that worke of Creation, wherein the manner of the worke of the Father appeared in a ſpeciall manner, and the manner of the worke of the Son appeared in redemption, and the manner of the worke of the holy Ghoſt appeared in ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo that God the Father was the firſt in the worke of the Creation, the Sonne ſecond in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4396:80"/>
worke of redemption, the holy Ghoſt third in the worke of ſanctification: Now creation being the worke wherein the power of the Father did moſt ſhew it ſelfe, <hi>Adam</hi> falling away from this, did principally wrong the Father, for his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worke appearing herein: therefore <hi>Adam</hi> did herein goe directly croſſe to God. Excellent is that phraſe, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1. <hi>Little children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſinne not;</hi> but ſome may ſay, what if we doe ſinne? why ſaith hee, <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, even Ieſus Christ the Iust.</hi> Now no man ſaith, wee have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with an advocate, no, for that were abſurd: for no advocate pleads to another advocate, but he pleads to the partie offended, for the partie which hath offended: now in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, even Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ:</hi> It is plaine that God the Father was the Perſon directly offended; the iſſue then is thus much; The Father being the Creditor, and the Perſon directly offended, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt became our Suretie, and the creditor doth require the debt at the hands of our Suretie, and acquits the debtor; the creditor requires this, but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance comes mainly and properly from the Father, becauſe the debt was due to him: ſo that God the Father is the Creditor, the Sonne is the Suretie, the poore ſinner is the debtor, the holy Spirit is the meſſenger, that brings the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from God the Father, and ſaith, loe the Father hath accepted of thee in his Sonne, the Suretie hath paid the debt for thee, and ſee here

is the acquittance for thee; ſo that though the holy Ghoſt doth bring the acquittance, yet the Father muſt give it: This is the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Secondly, wee ſay that Iuſtification is an act of God the Father, becauſe the Father is the fountaine in the Deity, as Divines uſe to ſay, in all the workes that are done by the Deitie, the Father is the firſt: for as the Perſons are in their being, ſo they are in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: The Father in order workes before the Son and the holy Ghoſt; the Sonne workes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father hath wrought, and the holy Ghoſt workes not before the Father and the Son have wrought. Hence it is that actions are given eſpecially to the Father, though not excluding the Sonne, nor the holy Ghoſt; but yet howſoever they are all equall in their working, in regard of time, yet the Father is firſt in regard of order. A malefactor is now arraigned and condemned, and the pardon is to be begged, and none but the Kings ſonne, the young Prince, can have a pardon, his abilities are onely able to carry him through the worke; the Prince begs it, the Favorite brings it, but the King onely grants it: ſo it is here, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt is the Sonne of the everlaſting Father, and the Prince of peace, and hee it is that begs the pardon of his Father, hee ſends it to us by the hands of the holy Ghoſt, but only the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grants the pardon.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, there are ſome actions which doe remain in God, which are confined within the compaſſe of his owne Councell, and goe no further, and they are immanent actions, they ſtay in God and goe no further. A man may conceive in his mind what hereſolves to doe in his heart; whether hee will doe ſuch a thing or no, and no man can tell what he intends to doe but himſelfe; but if a man will practiſe anſwerably according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then he doth expreſſe the worke outwardly, which he intended inwardly, and now hee workes upon the creature, and makes it to receive ſome impreſſion of that good which hee kept ſecretly in himſelfe. There are ſome actions which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in God, as the decrees and purpoſes of God, before the foundation of the world, and they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4396:81"/>
are confined within the high Councell table of Heaven, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, and theſe never appeared to the eye of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there are actions alſo which paſſe from God upon the creature, and doe worke a change and an alteration upon the creature; and theſe wee call tranſient actions, or actions that paſſe, which are not onely in God, but paſſe from God, and doe frame, and order, and diſpoſe of the creature, as God ſees fit; and of this ſort are all the actions that belong to a Chriſtian, except pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination: for the Lord doth not reveale thoſe ſecrets unto any by the worke of vocation, which is wrought upon the creature, for there the Lord quickens deſire, and ſtirres up hope, and kindles love and joy, and the Lord turnes the face of the ſoule God-ward, and in adoption, regeneration, and all the workes of grace and ſalvation, and of this kinde is juſtification: and this is the reaſon why I call it a tranſient action, becauſe it paſſeth upon the creature, but that muſt be warily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with a graine of ſalt, as the Proverbe is: now what change is this? I anſwer, the Lord workes a change upon the creature two wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Lord is ſaid to paſſe a worke or an action upon the creature, when he puts ſome kind of abilitie upon the creature, either ſpirituall, or naturall: as when the Lord makes a wicked man, a good man; an adulterous man, a chaſte man; and of an envious proud malicious man, a patient meeke and holy man; and this we call a naturall change, becauſe there is a gracious frame put into
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4396:82"/>
the heart and ſoule which overpowers the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all things are become new; new affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, new deſires: but this is not all, for here is the difficultie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Lord is ſaid to make a change upon the creature, when he takes off ſome relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reſpects which the creature had, and puts upon it ſome other reſpects, hee doth not put them into the ſoule, but puts the ſoule into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther roome, and they are not naturally qualities, but onely relations, which are imprinted upon the ſoule of man, and theſe are called morall, and of this kinde is juſtification, as thus: Take a Prentice that is bound by covenant and Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for ſo many yeeres, and he is now fallen into an ague, or a burning fever, hee hath two relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Firſt, he is an apprentice: Secondly, hee hath a weake ſickly diſtempered body: now there may bee a double change wrought in this man, according to this double diſpoſition: firſt the maſter burnes the Indentures, and gives him his time, and ſets him free from his ſervice, and hee that was an apprentice before, is now a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, this is a morall change, for all this while he is as ſicke as he was before: but the former rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is quite gone, and the maſter cannot now command him to his ſervice; now the fellow ſervants cannot dominere over him, becauſe he is not now a ſervant: but now the wiſe Phyſitian he comes, and he by good means helps the man of his diſeaſe, and brings him to a faire, ſweet, and wholſome temper of body, and now there is a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4396:82"/>
change in the very nature of this ſervant; before he was diſtempered, but now he is well ordered; before hot, but now finely coole: here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wrought in the nature of this man. Juſt ſo it is in this change of the ſoule: there is a morall change in juſtification, a man is bound to the Law, and liable to the penaltie of it, and guiltie of the breach of it: now God the Father in Jeſus Chriſt, acquits a man of this guilt, and delivers him from this revenging power of the Law, and thats not all, but withall hee puts holineſſe into the heart, and wiſedome into the minde, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie into the affections, &amp; this is called a naturall change, becauſe there are new ſpiritual abilities put into the heart; not becauſe of the nature of it, but becauſe of the thing which it works: as to take the example of Scripture, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. <hi>Wee are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from death to life:</hi> As it is with a man taken priſoner in Turkie, or ſome other place, haply a Chriſtian of England, he is accounted a Traitor there, and is condemned as a Traitor: the man being weake of himſelfe, and not able to deliver himſelfe, he muſt bee dealt by as a Traitor: but now if this man bee reſcued, and finde ſome way of eſcape, and bee ſet upon ſome other ſhore, whereby he may be conveyed into England, then he is here accounted a good ſubject, and he is ſo far from being condemned, that hee is wonderfully advanced and honoured by the King: here is a change, in Turkie hee was condemned as a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but in England hee is counted a good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and is received into favour, and honoured;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4396:83"/>
here is a morall change: but now here is no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall change, here is nothing put into this man: If he were ignorant before, he is ignorant ſtill; if he were wicked before, he is wicked ſtill: but he hath a good relation as a ſubject, and is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in England: he is in another roome and rank, this is a morall change: But now if a man were ignorant before, and ſince he came into England he were framed and made wiſe and holy, this is a ſpirituall change: before hee was ignorant, and now hee is learned; before graceleſſe, but now gracious: this is a naturall change, or rather a ſpirituall change. Juſt ſo it is with a faithfull ſoule, the poore ſinner as hee is landed here upon the ſhore of ſinne and corruption, take him as he is by nature, he is liable to divine juſtice, and a Traitor in Gods account, and as he ſtands liable to the Law hee is a damned man, hee is ſicke of ſinne. But now when the Father hath brought him home to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and landed him upon another Coaſt, hee is now ſure to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of life, and of ſalvation in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and he that before was attached of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is acquitted of all in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the reſpects of treaſon and condemnation are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and other reſpects and relations are put on: this is done in juſtification, and afterward when hee is juſtified, then the Lord will honour and adorne the ſoule; ſo that though the ſoule before was ignorant, the Lord will now make him wiſe unto ſalvation; though before hee were polluted, yet now hee ſhall bee ſanctified. And
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4396:83"/>
thus much of the reaſons why I call it an act of God the Father upon the beleever.</p>

Were he not worthy to be begged for a foole, that ſhould goe away troubled and diſquieted, becauſe a company of drunkards had condemned him upon the alebench, when the Judge had cleared him upon the bench of juſtice: therefore ſteele your faces againſt all the malicious accuſations of the wicked: let them ſit and condemne thee upon the alebench if they will, ſo long as thou art acquitted in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, herein bee for ever cheared through his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

them no more, I will not owne them, I have done it too too much already, if they come I will not yeeld; and if they follow, I will flee. I have read an old ſtory of a man that was carried away much by a harlot; at laſt the Lord meets him, and opened his eyes, and humbled his ſoule, and brought him out of his ſinfull condition: many a day after the harlot met him againe, and the man would not looke on her, and ſhee began to ſeft kindneſſe upon him, and ſaid, I am ſhe, you know wee have had much ſweet dalliance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Oh, but ſaith he, bleſſed be God, I am not I; that is, I am not the man that I was before: ſo ſhould we, though wee are nothing but ſinne by nature, and know nothing but corruption, yet if the old ſluggiſhneſſe and ſtubbornnes of heart, and haughtineſſe that we have too too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; if they come and ſay, we are the darlings that have had much ſweet fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with you, make them anſwer and ſay, I am not the man, I will have no more to doe with you.

much, that our Saviour had the debt of a ſinner charged upon him, partly by imputation, and partly by perſonall performance, he did performe the payment perſonally, the debt was by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the payment was by reall and perſonall performance: and as our ſinnes and debts were made his by imputation, ſo the payment was his really laid downe, and ſuffered for us: Two things I muſt lay downe before I can open the point:</p>

judgement it is to bee taken in the firſt ſenſe, though the ſecond alſo muſt bee included, and cannot but be collected from the former, and not onely the former, but alſo latter Divines car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it this way: the argument here in the Text ſeemes to bee cleare, and the reaſons out of the Text are three:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, looke at the oppoſition that is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſinne and righteouſneſſe; <hi>God made Christ ſinne for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in Christ:</hi> that ſinne is here meant which is oppoſite to that righteouſneſſe which is here mentioned; but the ſacrifice of ſinne is not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the righteouſneſſe here meant, but the breach of the Law that is oppoſite to it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore righteouſneſſe doth imply the profeſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſinne in this place, ſinne being profeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if wee looke at the compariſon and proportion betweene the firſt part of the verſe, and the laſt part, <hi>For as Christ was made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes to us;</hi> not that righteouſnes which we have, but that which hee had, and which is made ours by imputation: ſo Chriſt alſo was made ſinne for us, not that Chriſt had ſinne, but hee tooke our ſinne by imputation: ſo that I reaſon thus; That ſinne is here meant, which is ſo imputed to Chriſt, as his righteouſneſſe is imputed to us: but not the ſufferings or puniſhments of ſinne is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, but the guilt and the breach, Chriſt did really and perſonally ſuffer; and therefore hee needed no ſuch imputation for ſuffering, but for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4396:96"/>
the breach of the Law which hee never did, that onely is imputed to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, let us take what they give, and grant that Chriſt is our ſacrifice for ſinne, that very grant infers that Chriſt alſo muſt have ſinne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him; for hee that did really pay that which was due on our parts, and which the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God exacted as a due payment for what we had committed, hee muſt alſo have the debt imputed to him; for otherwiſe to make a man pay the debt which hee hath no relation to, and cannot be charged withall, this ſtands not with juſtice; but God the Father exacted payments and ſufferings from our Saviour for our ſinne; and therefore hee charged our Saviour with our ſinnes: As for example, a creditor ſues the ſuretie, and forceth him to pay the debt; why? becauſe hee ſtands charged with the debt, for when hee entred bond with the creditor, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuretie, and a debtor to pay the debt, and the debtor was acquitted: but now he that never was bound for the money, cannot bee forced to pay the debt: ſo that all things conſidered, it is evident <hi>that our Saviour was made ſinne,</hi> that is, that the ſinnes of the whole world were ſet upon his ſcore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, what is it to bee made ſinne? It is not to be meant, that Chriſt had any ſinne of his owne, no more than we had righteouſneſſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God the Father did make him ſinfull, theſe are helliſh and devilliſh blaſphemies: but we muſt underſtand it ſo, as may ſtand with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4396:97"/>
Gods Juſtice, Holineſſe, Chriſts puritie, &amp;c. God the Father charged all our ſinnes upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by imputation: but if you aske me, why doth the Text ſay, <hi>that he made him ſinne and not a ſinner;</hi> the reaſon is this, becauſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did not beare the ſinnes of any one man in particular, but he bore the ſinnes of all the world: all the evils which they had committed, were charged upon our Saviour, and God the Father followes the ſuit upon the ſuretie, and accounted him as the debte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, and as one that was guiltie of all thoſe ſinnes, becauſe hee had taken them upon him; ſo the point of Doctrine hence is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label> God the Father did impute all the ſinnes of all the world to the charge of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>All you that are debters to the Lord, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it; if a man had forfeited his bond, and had great payments to make, if hee knew any friend that would become a debter for him and would pay the debt, oh how would he rejoyce! Now we are all debters and ſtand bound to God, therefore take notice of the point, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged all the ſinnes of all the faithfull up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: if you aske mee why I ſay the faithfull; becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>Hee was made ſinne for us</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>for us that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve:</hi> he would be ſure to have ſome of that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as he ſaith in another place, <hi>Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, whereof I am chiefe:</hi> hee, ingroſſeth mercy to himſelfe; therefore you hard hearted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving wretches bee packing, <hi>for Christ was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4396:97"/>
made ſinne for us,</hi> that is, <hi>for us beleevers:</hi> ſo that none of the faithfull are exempted from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Doctrine; <hi>Christ was made ſinne for every beleever,</hi> for every beleeving creature in the world that can but reſt upon Chriſt, and can touch the hemme of his garment: it is not the greatneſſe of your faith, but the ſinceritie of your faith, that helps you to come within compaſſe of this point. For the proofe of this Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thus much: this is a truth of the Scripture undeniable, and that which hath from age to age beene delivered to the people of God, all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and ſacrifices of the Law doe ſhew ſo much, and all the types of the Law doe teſtifie ſo much, as in <hi>Leviticus</hi> 1.4. compare it with <hi>Leviticus</hi> 5.5. in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.4. he ſaith, <hi>The offender ſhall bring the burnt offering without blemiſh, and hee ſhall put his hands upon the head of the ſacrifice, and it ſhall bee accepted of the Lord to bee an attonement:</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.5. <hi>When he hath ſinned in any of theſe things, then he ſhall come and confeſſe that he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein;</hi> this was the legall ceremony: now what is the ſubſtance of it? the ſacrifices were types of Chriſt, hee is the ſacrifice without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, without ſinne, and the offering up of the ſacrifice was the beleeving upon, and the tendering of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to God the Father by faith, and this muſt bee done at the doore of the Tabernacle: the meaning is, he is a common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to all beleevers, that as it is in a common ground, every one hath a ſhare in it, and every borderer though never ſo poore, may come and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4396:98"/>
put on and feed his cattle as well as the beſt: ſo here every poore beleever may come and feed upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the 3. verſe of <hi>Iude</hi> cals it <hi>the common ſalvation;</hi> not common to all the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, but to all the faithfull that border upon the promiſes, and doe beleeve in them, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all; and the man that offered the ſacrifice was to lay his hand upon the head of the ſacrifice, and there to confeſſe all the ſinnes of the children of Iſrael; this was the unburthening himſelfe of his ſinne, and laying it upon the head of the ſacrifice the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that ſo what wee are not able to beare, hee may beare for us, and anſwer divine juſtice for us; and ſo there was another ceremony, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 16.21. Of the ſcape goat, there were two ſacrifices to bee offered, the one was to bee a burnt offering, and the other was to eſcape; <hi>Aaron was to put his hand upon the head of the live goat, and to confeſſe over him all the iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and their treſpaſſes, putting them upon the head of the live goat, and ſhall ſend him away by the hand of a man appointed into the wilderneſſe; ſo the goat ſhall beare upon him all the iniquities to a land not inhabited: and the other was to be offered up for a burnt offering:</hi> this was the type; now the intendment of the ceremony was this; the goat was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>when Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron did put his hands upon the head of the goat, and confeſſe over him all the iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and did put them upon the head of the goat;</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:4396:98"/>
it was thus much, God the Father did charge all the ſinnes of all the world upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, even of all, from the beginning of the world to the end of it, and did put them all upon the Lord Chriſt; and howſoever he was a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſinne, yet hee was a ſcape goat, and hath eſcaped out of the hands of hell and death, and is now in Heaven, and with him all beleevers ſhall eſcape from hell and death, by the power of his merits. Further ye ſee how the Prophet expounds the Law, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.4, 5. <hi>We thought him afflicted and buffetted for himſelfe, but he was wounded for our ſins, and broken for our iniquities;</hi> hee was neglected amongſt the wicked, and they judged him as ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for his owne ſins, <hi>but he was wounded for our ſins imputed to him, that wee through him might bee eaſed thereof;</hi> and therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>Hee bore our iniquities:</hi> and me thinkes it hath reference to the ſcape goat, and it is that which the Apoſtle doth peremptorily ſay, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>He was made a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a better covenant:</hi> Now the ſuretie hath not onely the payment to make, but hee is accounted as the debtor; the debt is laid to his charge, as well as the payment is required, thus the point is proved: Now for the better diſcovery of this Doctrine, let me doe two things:</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, our Saviour having undertaken to keepe theſe, he addreſſeth himſelfe to the worke, to uſe thoſe means by which hee may keepe and ſave them, and that he doth thus: he puts himſelfe into the roome and place of all thoſe poore loſt ſheepe of his, and this is the difficultie to open this to you that are weake. Now what is it to be put in the roome and place of another? Chriſt doth willingly ſubmit himſelfe to the power of the revenging juſtice of the Father, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Law and Juſtice of God required at the hands of the faithfull, that doth Chriſt ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and will anſwer it all, as thus: the debter is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and impriſoned, and they that are his friends deſire ſome releaſment for him; how upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, and conference with the creditor, it is agreed that ſuch a man ſhall undertake to help him, and to free him from all the extremitie that he lies in for the debt, and hee muſt doe it by one of theſe two wayes, either hee muſt breake the priſon, and ſo reſcue him by ſtrong hand, or elſe he muſt yeeld and ſubmit to what the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and is due to the creditor; and the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſaith, if you will bee content to become deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and acquit him of the debt, if you will enter bond with me to become a pay-maſter of the whole debt due to me, then I am content to free him: Now the man that thus yeelds himſelfe, to what the power of Law and Juſtice can do againſt the debtor, that man becomes a ſuretie for him,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4396:101"/>
he will bee as one that owes the money, and that muſt pay, and the Law proceeds as fully againſt him, as againſt the debtor: the debtor did perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally owe the money, and lay in priſon for it, but the ſuretie is as one that hath forfeited and muſt pay; hee ſubmits himſelfe to the power of Law, and Juſtice, that looke what the Law requires of a man forfeiting and owing, hee is content that the Law require it of him. Juſt ſo it is here, the ſinner is this debtor, and Chriſt undertakes for him by a mutuall conſent betweene the Father and him, and hee yeelds and ſubmits himſelfe to all the power of Juſtice, that looke how the Law accounts of a ſinner, it ſhould account of him: Now the Law of God accounts of this man as one that hath broken the Law, and deſerved eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, and Chriſt ſubmits himſelfe to theſe, the Law requires doing and ſuffering, and Chriſt is contented to undergoe all theſe for all that ſhall beleeve: as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>When the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his onely Sonne made of a woman, and made under the Law, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme them which were under the Law:</hi> the meaning is this, looke how we were under the Law, ſo was Chriſt under the Law for us, that ſo he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thoſe that were under the Law; the Law laid guilt to our charge, and the Law did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us, and the Lord Chriſt was content to be under all that commanding, revenging authority, which the Law had over us, ſo that now Chriſt is come into the roome of all the faithfull: hence is that ſpeech of <hi>Luther,</hi> which the Papiſts ſo
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4396:101"/>
much cavill at; hee ſaith our Saviour was the greateſt ſinner of all the faithfull that ever was upon the face of the earth, not that he had any ſin of his owne inherent in him, or committed by him, but becauſe all the ſins of all the world were charged upon him, and Chriſt put himſelfe into the roome of all the world, that looke whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Law required of any, the ſame it required of him; and what the Law accounted of any, it accounted the ſame of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, our Saviour having put himſelfe into the roome of a ſinner, the Law now proceeds with full ſcope againſt him, and God the Father may juſtly proceed according to rule, and may juſtly expreſſe the power of his revenging Juſtice upon him: and hence it is that God the Father accounts of Jeſus Chriſt as a ſinner, and proceeds againſt him, and condemnes him as a ſinner, and doth require of him whatſoever hee requires of a ſinner, a ſinner muſt doe or die, and ſo muſt the Lord Chriſt, becauſe hee hath put himſelfe into the roome of a ſinner. As it is with a creditor, haply the debtor growes a bankrupt, and flies his countrie, the creditor cares not, for, ſaith hee, I will lay the debt upon the ſureries backe, ſuch a man was bound for him, I have him ſtill in my cheſt, and it is as good to mee, as if the debtor himſelfe were able to pay me: ſo it is here when poore ſinners wrong God, and wound his Spirit, and diſhonour his Name, and tranſgreſſe his Lawes, and they are not able to anſwer him one of a thouſand, though they ſhould goe to bell

Thus much of the firſt part of the diſcovery of this point, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged our ſinnes upon our Saviour, and that Chriſt charged them upon himſelfe, they both make a compact, that poore loſt man ſhall be ſaved, and Chriſt ſubmits, and is contented to beare their ſinnes, and to have the Law proceed againſt him.</p>

out all his abominations out of record, <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things against me,</hi> that is, the Lord tooke all the advantages againſt him that might be, and ſaid, <hi>Remember the old lusts of thy heart, and the vanities of thy youth;</hi> and this made him <hi>like a drie leafe toſſed too and fro:</hi> as verſe 25.

acknowledge that it were juſt with the Lord to let looſe his ſinne, howſoever not to condemne him, yet to make him live at little peace or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; and hence it is that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> praies ſo againſt it, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51.9. when he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe two great ſins of adultery and murther, though God after his confeſſion had ſealed to his ſoule the pardon of them, yet hee went with broken bones; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Hide away thy face from my ſinnes, and put away all mine iniquities;</hi> as if he had ſaid, looke not upon my ſinnes as a judge, doe not follow the Law againſt me, let not my ſinnes, or my perſon bee once brought into the Court, or bee once named, but looke upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for mee, and for his ſake blot out all mine iniquities.</p>

a man would thinke that hee would have beene comforted, and gone away cheerfully, having the pardon of his ſinnes: but marke how hee cries, <hi>Have mercy upon me oh God, according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thy compaſsions, waſh away all my tranſgreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: waſh mee throughly from all my tranſgreſsions, and purge mee from my ſinne.</hi> Hee had not onely need of Chriſt before his converſion to juſtifie him, but he had need of Chriſt now to continue the aſſurance of his juſtification; it is not a drop, but a bucket full of mercy; not a little mercy, but a whole ocean: Lord, I have had a great deale of mercy for the ſinnes of my youth, and I have need of a great deale of mercy ſtill to waſh away the guilt of my ſinnes: this the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of every man that did offer ſacrifice, as they were to offer their dayly ſacrifice, ſo wee have dayly need of Chriſt, and therefore wee muſt have a dayly recourſe to Chriſt: therefore the ſacrificer <hi>was to lay his hands upon the head of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi> Even ſo doe thou lay thine hands upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and reſt upon him, and thou ſhalt finde acceptance with him, this is that which ſometimes chears up the drooping heart, and bears it up in the midſt of all the waves of wickedneſſe, when he ſees the vanitie of his mind, and the deadneſſe of his heart, and frothineſſe of his ſpeech, and now ſinne, and then ſinne, and in every thing ſinne, as you cannot but ſee and confeſſe it: this ſtands the poore ſinner in ſtead when hee conſiders this, and ſaith, though I am dayly ſinning, yet there is a Saviour in Heaven,

and mercy and grace in him, that I may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted therein for ever, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 7.25. <hi>Hee is able to ſave to the uttermost, thoſe that come to God by him:</hi> It implies theſe two things, not onely from all ſinne, but alſo at all times; not onely from the ſinnes of your youth, but alſo to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of your dayes: the reaſon is, hee lives for ever to doe it; this is the chearing of a poore ſinner, and this wee ſhould labour to maintain, and to keepe the ſight and ſenſe of our ſinne, though our ſinnes endure for ever, our living and ſinning goe together, and we ſtill continue to be as ſinfull, and lazy, and idle, as ever; yet ſee a need of a Saviour that lives for ever, and hee is able to ſave for ever: He hath not onely beene a Saviour in times paſt, but hee is ſtill; you may haply live many daies, and therefore goe to Chriſt which liveth for ever, to pardon and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for the comfort of the ſoule.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4396:109"/>
upon thy owne ſoule, that thou maiſt be affected with it, and be carried with a hatred to it, and a reſolution to get more ſtrength and power againſt it: Famous is that example of <hi>David</hi> herein, and this was the cauſe of his practice; it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Familiſts, that if he had once gotten the aſſurance of Gods love, he might have gone away cheared, but though the Lord had pardoned his ſinne, yet he would not pardon ſinne in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: the Lord ſhewed mercy to his ſoule, but yet he would not ſhew any pittie to his ſinne, but ſhewed all the hatred and revenge againſt it, that poſſibly he could: As the Apoſtle ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the inceſtuous <hi>Corinth, Ye ſhould rather have ſorrowed, that the ſinne might have beene removed; had you ſorrowed for your ſinnes, then you would have reſisted them;</hi> And when hee had ſhewed them their tranſgreſſions, and convinced them of their ſinnes, ſee what fruit it wrought in them, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4396:109"/>
Chriſt, then there is a daily need to repent and ſorrow for ſinne; for if he muſt be more ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then he muſt bee more mortified; therefore he muſt daily ſee his ſinnes or elſe hee will never ſee a need of Chriſt, nor repent, nor bee more ſanctified nor mortified: Againe, if every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever muſt expreſſe his love unto God daily, then he muſt hate every thing that is evill. I hope you will confeſſe that every beleever is bound to love Jeſus Chriſt, therefore he muſt hate ſinne; and if hee muſt hate ſinne that hee may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, then hee muſt mourne for it when it is committed. If a man have any good nature, it will worke trouble in his heart, to thinke that hee ſhould ſinne againſt ſo good a God; thus farre a Chriſtian ought to goe, and muſt goe in the charging himſelfe with his ſinne.</p>

him to be ſome notorious malefactor, ſome mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, whom though he had eſcaped the Sea, yet vengeance hath not ſuffered him to liue: but marke what the Text ſaith, <hi>Hee ſhooke off the viper into the fire, and had no hurt;</hi> this viper would have ſlaine him, being a deadly venomous creature, but <hi>Paul</hi> had a promiſe before, that if he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any poyſonfull thing, it ſhould not hurt him. This is the admirable happineſſe of the Saints, and ſervants of God: oh that they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it. All thy pride, and envie, and malice, and covetouſneſſe, all thy ſinnes are of a poyſonous viperous nature, but if thou art a beleever, if a true penitent and convert, thou haſt the promiſe, that the ſting of the Serpent, ſinne, ſhall not hurt thee, it is taken off from thee, and laid upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore ſhake off the guilt of all thy abominations, and goe on cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and comfortably to Chriſt, and yet humbly too, and praiſe his Name that hee hath beene pleaſed to take that guilt of ſinne upon him, which thou wert never able to beare: therefore, though all thy pride, thy rebellion and other ſins ſhould come in againſt thee; as the ſinnes of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> if thou repenteſt and forſakeſt them, yet they ſhall never be able to faſten any guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee to condemne thee. Looke as it was with the three children, the fire in its owne nature was able to burne them; therefore <hi>they that put them in were conſumed by the flame, but the three children had no hurt:</hi> the Lord ſtopped the power of the flames, that it burnt onely their bonds, but <hi>not one haire of

their head was ſienged, nor there was no ſmell of fire upon them;</hi> it was not becauſe the fire would not, or could not, but the Lord ſtopt the acting of the fire. So every ſinne is able to faſten guilt upon thee, and to condemne thee, but upon thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the Lord hinders it in the act; and therefore though ſinne doth ſend the wicked and impenitent downe to hell to frie in torments, yet it ſhall never ſend thee downe, nor faſten guilt upon thee: Thus it was likewiſe with <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 6.22, 23, 24. when he was put into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons denne, the Princes of the king <hi>Darius</hi> had a ſpleene againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> becauſe he was a holy man, and had gotten ſome intereſt in the kings favour, and they could get no hold againſt him, but in the matter of his God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now hee that loved God better than himſelfe, <hi>He opens his window boldly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Ieruſalem, profeſsing Gods truth when hee was called to it, therefore they went to the king to have him to be caſt into the den of Lions, according to the decree; now he was caſt into it, and though the Lions were hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, yet God ſhut the mouth of the Lions, they had power, and were able to hurt him if they had not beene restrained, but God had ſhut up their mouthes that they could not hurt him;</hi> but <hi>when the enemies of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel were caſt into the denne, the Lions did teare them all to peeces, before they came at the bottome of the denne they rent them in peeces ſuddenly:</hi> whats the reaſon of it? they had as much power before, and were as able and as hungry before, but <hi>the Lord ſtopt their mouths, that they could not devour Daniel:</hi> Juſt ſo it is with the ſinnes of the penitent, and the

The text ſaith, <hi>Chriſt tooke fleſh on him, and it was ſinfull fleſh by ſimilitude or imputation,</hi> not actually by commiſſion; the nature of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had no evill inherent in him nor committed by him, but hee was only a ſinner by imputation,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4396:112"/>
and then he condemned ſinne in the fleſh, what is that? it is a law caſe, and Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> hath it excellently, he damned ſinne, as a man will ſay when he loſeth the ſuit, hee fell from his cauſe, and from his plea which he made, he loſt it utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo Chriſt taking upon him our nature by imputation, he made ſinne loſe its claime which it would make to the ſoule in this caſe, hee that breaketh the Law of God is guiltie, and ſhall be condemned by it: but this man hath broken the Law of God, and therefore is guiltie of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereby: Now Chriſt takes off theſe, and ſaith, <hi>It is true, hee is guiltie of ſinne, and worthy of condemnation, unleſſe another be contented to be guilty for him, but I have undertaken the guilt for him, and have paid the debt for him; and therefore this ſoule is free from ſinne, thou haſt nothing to doe with this ſoule, neither ſhalt thou condemne him.</hi> Obſerve it, when all your ſinnes ſhall muſter in upon you, and come from Eaſt to Weſt, ſaying, thou art guiltie of pride, guiltie of malice, &amp;c. and ſhalt be condemned for them; make anſwer and ſay it is true, Lord, I am ſo, but Chriſt hath taken away the guilt and condemnation, and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of my ſinnes: therefore, ſinne, thou haſt nothing to doe with this ſoule of mine, Chriſt hath taken it and redeemed it, and therefore I leave it with him: This is the firſt concluſion.</p>

                  <p>I ground this Doctrine out of the Text thus; the text ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was made ſinne,</hi> that is, <hi>he had our ſinnes imputed to him, and therefore hee muſt bee made a ſacrifice for ſinne, and beare the puniſhment of ſinne:</hi> If Chriſt became a debtor for us, then he muſt alſo lay downe the payment of the debt, onely here remember this; conſider the bounds and limits of this mercy of the Lord, it is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely to the faithfull, they onely ſhare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and are partakers of that benefit that comes by the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>To prove this Doctrine, looke <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 2.17. compare it with <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 4.15.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4396:115"/>
they were laid,</hi> that is, <hi>God made all the ſorrowes, and all the puniſhments of all the faithfull to meet upon our Saviour.</hi> It is a terme taken from warre, when an army is levied out, every towne and countie ſets out ſo many men, and they all meet at ſuch a place ſuch a day: ſo every faithfull ſoule ſets out miſeries, and mans out afflictions, and they all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie out an army of ſorrowes, and they all meet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviour: all thoſe ſinnes and miſeries of the godly from one end of the world to the other, from eaſt to weſt, from north to ſouth, they run amain upon our Saviour, and beſiege the ſoule and body of him, and they lie heavie upon him, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him; that is, it overwhelmed him for the while, and made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Another proofe of this point is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, every beleever may and ſhould under the authoritie of mercy, challenge mercy, and in the vertue of the death of Chriſt he ſhould bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay downe his life. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt;</hi> that is the value of the phraſe, in the vertue of the death of Chriſt wee die alſo; that as he died, &amp; by his owne power roſe againe: ſo alſo wee die, that wee may riſe againe. The Saints of God die that they may bee like to Chriſt, and be raiſed againe, and ſo bee for ever happy with Chriſt; this is the particular good that the death of Chriſt communicates to the faithfull ones, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.36. <hi>Thou foole, that which thou ſomeſt, it is not quickned, unleſſe it die; it muſt firſt be corrupted, that it may grow againe into an eare of corne:</hi> the meaning is, a man therefore dies, that he may riſe againe, the body muſt lie downe in the duſt: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53. <hi>This corruption muſt put on incorruption; and this mortalitie muſt put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie:</hi> Now corruption cannot put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4396:121"/>
nor mortalitie cannot put on immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, ſo long as wee are here: the body of <hi>Adam</hi> could not be made immortall of it ſelfe, the frame of it would not affoord ſo much, for <hi>Adams</hi> body needed meat, and had it; but immortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies need no food, but live by the power of Gods Spirit: therefore Chriſt tooke downe the frame of this nature, that hee might make it a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent frame. It is therefore ſaid, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian dies rather in the authoritie of mercy, than juſtice; that as Chriſt died and roſe again, ſo Chriſt will have all his ſervants die, that hee may of a corrupt nature, and a mortall body, make an immortall body; he will make it immortall, which nature it ſelfe, no not in its perfection, could not doe: this is the firſt privilege.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond privilege which beleevers receive is this, the death of the beleever puts an end to all his ſinnes, and miſeries, and ſorrowes; that when the ſoule and body ſhall part in ſunder, then ſin ſhall depart from both; and when they goe out of this life, they ſhall goe from all the miſeries of this life: we ſhall never bee more peſtered with luſts, and corruptions, we ſhall never bee drawne from the Lord more, Satan is now buſie, but when the Saints of God die, there is a ſeparation from all ſinnes, from all ſorrowes, from all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, never to be aſſaulted more: this is the meaning of that place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Everywhere we beare about in our bodies the dying of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that the life alſo of Ieſus may be made manifeſt in our mortall bodies:</hi> the meaning is this, Chriſt by his

Now I have a little mercy, and a little holineſſe, and a little pardon of ſinne; but oh that I might injoy my Saviour fully: Now it is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary with the wicked; the death of the wicked is a means to ſhut them out of all the hope they had of receiving mercy, for when death parts ſoule and body, then there is no more cards and dice, no more luſts; the adulterer ſhall no more ſatiſfie himſelfe with his unclean luſts, the drunkard ſhall not then bee drunke, the blaſphemer ſhall not then blaſpheme ſo as hee was wont to doe for nothing, but he ſhall be and blaſpheme God for ſomething, and his ſoule ſhall bee full of Gods vengeance; this is the death of the wicked: the death of the Saints is like a ferriman to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them over to eternall happineſſe; but the death of the wicked is as a hangman to bereave them of life and ſalvation too: death to the ſaints is as a guide to convey them to happineſſe, but to the wicked, death is as a Jailor to carry

God the Father condemned him as guiltie: ſo runs the phraſe of Scripture, <hi>Hee ſuffered for our ſinnes, and the chastiſement of our peace was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and by his ſtripes we were healed:</hi> he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for any ſinnes that he had committed, but for the condition of all ſinfull nature imputed to him, and theſe divers reſpects wee doe practiſe, for ordinarily we are bound to love a creature as God made him, and then to hate him as hee makes himſelfe ſinfull, the Judge goes to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of a <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> and his ſonne comes before him in the perſon of the debter: now though the Judge love him as a ſonne, yet he will condemne him as a ſuretie; the Judge loves and pitties him in one regard, but yet hee paſſeth ſentence againſt him in another regard: So it is here with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when God the Father ſtands upon the tribunall of juſtice, and was pleaſed to follow the ſuit againſt the partie offending, our Saviour ſteps into our roome, and ſubmits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the cenſure of the Father, and as we were accounted, ſo he was content to bee accounted; and as we were to ſuffer, ſo he was content to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for us: God the Father loved him as he was God, and holy, and innocent; yet he condemnes him, and lets in his wrath upon him as he was to beare our ſins; for God the Father might love Jeſus Chriſt, and yet give his body to death naturall: ſo God the Father might love the ſoule of our Saviour, and yet give it over to paine ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall: all the world confeſſeth that it was without anger that Chriſt died, and yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

doe come properly out of our corruptions, and flow out from thence; and as heat and fire goe together, ſo ſin and miſery goe together; but there was no ſuch matter in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; nay, there was no outward cauſe in our Saviour, that could compell him to ſuffer miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whether he would or no: but hee did moſt willingly ſubmit himſelfe to divine juſtice, her tooke our place and became our ſuretie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the payment of the debt freely; yet aſide he had done thus, it was neceſſary upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſed, and hee did alſo willingly make it neceſſary, that before he did ſuffer theſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſhould undertake them; and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus undertaken, and upon certaine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions promiſed, it was very fit and neceſſary that he ſhould make good what he had promiſed, and performe what hee had undertaken: theſe cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I thought good to adde to ſtop the mouthed of all cavils that may ariſe in the hearts of thoſe that are weake; for the ground of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings was freely and willingly according to the promiſe and agreement which was betweene the Father and himſelfe.</p>

ſuffer by communion and conſent betweene the ſoule and the body; as namely, therefore the ſoule is pierced, becauſe the body is pierced, no, but he did properly and immediately receive and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the wrath of God in his ſoule, as well as his body did death. The Scripture doth expreſſe it this way, and the Prophet foretold this in <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.10. <hi>God ſhall make his ſoule an offering for ſin:</hi> you know every offering implies a full payment; they did uſe to confeſſe their ſinnes over the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and then to ſlay it, intimating that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was to undergoe whatſoever puniſhment was due unto their ſinnes: and ſo did Chriſt doe in bearing our ſinnes, nay Chriſt himſelfe ſaith ſo: <hi>Matthew</hi> 26.38. <hi>My ſoule is very heavie and ſorrowfull, even unto the death:</hi> and that this muſt needs be the meaning of the text, it ſhall appeare by further explication, and therefore give mee leave to handle all the particulars of the ſufferings of our Saviour: and for our proceeding herein, that I may be plaine, and that this doctrine may drop as the dew, and that every ſpire of graſſe may receive ſome ſap and ſweetneſſe, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all moiſture there from, let me doe two things, wherein I will ſhew you that the ſufferings of our Saviour were done partly in the garden; and partly upon the croſſe; and for his agony in the garden, let me doe two things:</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the firſt, what our Saviour ſuffered when he was in that agony in the garden, <hi>when he crieth out, Father, if it be poſsible let this cap paſſe from me.</hi> The Scripture diſcovers the pith of all that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of ſoule, and the whole compaſſe of it, what it was that did thus fill the ſoule of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and that is in theſe two things, and you ſhall finde them both in <hi>Marke</hi> 13.33. where the text ſaith, when our Saviour was to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the combate, he ſaith thus; <hi>hee beganne to his amazed, and to be very heavie:</hi> let me expreſſe them thus: hee beganne to bee driven to an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to have his ſoule fild with the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lord.

The word amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes from a word that ſignifies to bee in a ſtand, or to be aſtoniſhed: ſuch a ſorrow as men uſe to have for the loſſe of ſome deare friend; nay the prepoſition in that which is added ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a griefe beyond aſtoniſhment: whatſoever griefe could befall a creature without ſinne, that all befell our Saviour: this word carries two things with it:</p>

The ſecond part is this, and that goes further, and our tranſlation expreſſeth it to the full; <hi>My ſoule beginnes to be very heavie,</hi> thats our tranſlation; but the word goes a degree fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when this ſorrow act onely ſtrooke and ſhooke the heart of our Saviour with the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, but it entred into his ſoule, and fild it abundantly, and rackt it to the uttermoſt of the abilities of nature to beare it: ſhall I deale na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly? this word <hi>heavie,</hi> carries two things with it. Firſt, that the ſoule of our Saviour was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and fild, being full: with the indignation of the Lord, and that heavy vexation that lay upon him: for ſo the word implies, abundance of miſery which doth beare downe the heart of a poore creature, but this was not in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: though his ſoule were filled brimme full of the indignation of the Lord, yet hee was not overcharged with it. Secondly, hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that all the faculties of the whole nature of the ſoule of our Saviour, they gathered up themſelves, and they drew up all their forces, to beare up themſelves againſt the wrath of the Lord, which was now comming upon them; all the powers of his ſoule, the minde and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4396:143"/>
and hope and feare, they were all gathered up: as in time of warre, the ſouldiers come all forth from their garriſons to cloſe in the maine battell; ſo the Lord Jeſus foreſaw the wrath of the Father comming againſt him, and hee drew forth all his abilities, and left all other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wholly, and brought them to fence and to fortifie themſelves to beare this wrath of the Lord; as if our Saviour had ſaid, Come yee all hither, and help to beare up my ſoule againſt the unſupportable wrath of God; this is the very skirt and ſelvedge of the word: yet obſerve this by the way, our Saviour was not deprived of this worke of any of his abilities, but onely they were cald off from all other imployments, and they wholly betooke themſelves to beane the wrath of the Lord, as the maine worke which now did lie upon them: and this may be done, and was done by our Saviour, and yet without ſinne.

heavie even unto the death:</hi> that is, my ſoule is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and beſet, and beleagered with ſorrowes, in every part, and I would expreſſe it thus: our Saviour Chriſt knowing Gods counſell and the hour approaching, and the thrones of juſtice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and God as an angry Judge ſitting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with all the bookes brought forth, and all the ſinnes of all the world there laid open, and God the Father as a Judge ſaith, theſe are the ſinnes of thoſe, for whom thou haſt undertaken to die, and if thou anſwer not for them they muſt be damned; and there he ſaw the ſinnes of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and withall, he ſaw the glorious attributes of God all comming out againſt him; and mercy pleads, I have beene deſpiſed; and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience pleads and ſaith, I haue beene deſpiſed; and juſtice pleads and ſaith, I have beene wronged by theſe men in the time of their ignorance: and therefore mercy, and patience, and goodneſſe, and holineſſe, and long ſuffering, and all theſe that have beene wronged, they all come to the Father for juſtice, and ſay, Theſe have beene oppoſers of thy grace, and ſpirit, and they have wronged us, if they be ſaved, Chriſt muſt be puniſhed; and hee ſeeth the wrath of the Lord making a breach againſt him, and ſeizing againſt him, and not onely ſo, but even all the Devils, and all the Jewes and Gentiles; God lets them all in upon our Saviour: now ſee whether hee had good cauſe to complaine; if hee looked up to God, there were all his attributes crying for juſtice
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4396:144"/>
againſt him, and death before his face, and the Jewes and the Gentiles, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> and all conſpired againſt him to bring in ſorrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviour: therefore hee cries, <hi>Oh my ſoule it heavie even to the death, my ſoule is beſet with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes;</hi> the Jewes, and the ſinnes of all the world will have my life; thus he began to be aſtonied, and was faine to gather up all his abilities, that hee might fortifie himſelfe againſt thoſe evills. This is the ſufferings of Chriſt in the garden, and yet I ſpeake under it; and if I had the tongues of men and of Angels, I could not expreſſe it; for theſe words are never read of any mortall man, but that there is weakneſſe in the ſame, onely Chriſt hath expreſt thus much, that howſoever miſery and wrath was able to overcome a poore creature, yet hee bore it, and that without ſinnes.

or a man may ſpeake if he will, or elſe if he will, he may keep ſilence: ſo Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to ſuffer for us, but provided when hee would, and as he would: <hi>Matthew</hi> 26.37. <hi>He began to wax ſorrowfull,</hi> that is, hee did it freely, hee entred into the combat of Gods diſpleaſure, he undertooke it when he would, and as much at once as he would, provided that hee did pay and ſuffer all, for the curſe doth not require that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer all at once, but onely that he ſhould ſatisfie the juſtice of God againe: the humane nature of Chriſt could not ſo well beare all the wrath of God at once; therefore he tooke it at three times: as when a man cannot well drinke a great potion at one draught, he drinkes and breathes, and then drinks againe and breathes, and then drinkes the third time: ſo Chriſt was reſolved to beare all the wrath of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was too grievous for the humane nature to drinke it all at once, therefore hee drinkes and breaths againe, and then drinkes the ſecond time, and breaths againe; and ſo drinkes the third time, and ſo our Saviour was able to ſuffer all, and not to bee driven to any diſtemper or weakneſſe; for all thoſe diſtempers of affections, they ariſe from theſe three grounds:
<list>
                        <item>1 Either affections prevent judgement:</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now our Saviour tooke one draught, and then breathed, and then tooke another draught, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> had againe, and ſo thinke it at the third time,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:4396:146"/>
ſo that none of all the ſorrowes of the agonie that he undertooke troubled him, becauſe hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke it when he would, and yet bore all, and ſo gave full ſatisfaction. Thus you ſee what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſuffered in the garden in his ſoule, and it was ſuch a kinde of ſorrow, that he tooke onely <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> with him, and no more.</p>
                  <p>Now in the next place, I come to faſten upon the proofe of the point, to wit, that this ſorrow muſt needs bee more than can come from the paines of death, and I ſhall make it good by force of argument, that this ſorrow cannot come barely from the naturall death; I ſhall give you grounds from Scripture, and from reaſon, and I reaſon thus:</p>
                  <p>All the ſorrowes that came upon our Saviour, they came by reaſon in this cup, that is, from theſe ſorrowes, and miſeries that he was to beare, both in the agonie in the garden, and upon the croſſe: Now that cup which brought aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in upon his ſoule, and fild it full of anguiſh, and drove him to an amaze, and not only to weep bitterly, but to trickle downe drops of clodded blood, that cup muſt needs bee more than the pains of a naturall death, but that cup which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all this, was that which brought them in, and made him thus to be aſtoniſhed, and fild his ſoule with anguiſh, and wreſted clodded blood from his body; therefore this was more than naturall death: the latter part of the argument is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, namely that the agonie came from this cup;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:4396:147"/>
therefore the cup was the cauſe of his ſorrowes, and griefes, and teares; but to thinke that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death ſhould drive our Saviour to this aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, it is unreaſonable to thinke it, that the Souldier ſhould beare that which the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot beare, and that many a poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that hath but a little grace, ſhould beare the paine of a naturall death for a good cauſe, and that comfortably; and ſhall not Chriſt the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all grace beare much more? it is unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for any man to thinke ſo: therefore there muſt be more than the paines of a naturall death, in the ſufferings of our Saviour. Hee that gave his Saints grace to beare theſe paines of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall death, he hath much more grace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to beare them, and to come forth from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is another interpretation of ſound Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which we muſt receive and yeeld unto. For the firſt, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others make the meaning of the words to be this, that our Saviour Chriſt here complaines that he was left to the hands of the Jewes, and that God the Father would not deliver him from that temporal death which they would put him to; therefore ſaid they, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the ſenſe of the death natural, cries out that God had left him in the hands of thoſe ungodly men; therefore they ſay the words run thus, <hi>My

God, my God, why haſt thou</hi> thus <hi>forſaken me,</hi> and loſt me thus in the hands of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and the Jewes to crucifie mee: it is a ſinew leſſe and a weake imagination, that I may ſpeake no worſe of it, for I can hardly beare it with patience: and that this ſenſe is falſe there are a reaſons to beare againſt it.

It is a weake thing for a man to ſay, that ſometimes the miſeries and deaths of the Saints of God, argue a forſaking of God: for I ſay, that though the Saints of God are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times delivered up to death by the wiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, yet they are not ſaid to bee forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Wee are perſecuted, but not forſaken; cast downe, but wee periſh not:</hi> You know what the ordinarie promiſes are in this kinde; <hi>I will be with thee in ſix troubles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

man, but eſpecially of the Jeſuites, whether of theſe two they will grant? God did not forſake the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the firſt way; therefore he muſt doe it this way, or none at all; and if any man grant this, then he grants the cauſe: for then there was not onely the death naturall, but the diſpleaſure of the Lord ſeized upon his ſoule; and unleſſe they doe grant this, then this abſurditie muſt needs follow upon it, that Chriſt was not at all forſaken of God: for he that was conſtantly aſſiſted, and refreſhed by the ſenſe of the love and favour of God, he was no way forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was in priſon, but God was with him; and <hi>Daniel</hi> was in the Lions den, but God was with him: and in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>God is with you, while yee are with him:</hi> now if Chriſt had aſſiſtance from God the Father to ſtrengthen him, and the ſenſe of the ſweetneſſe of Gods love to refreſh him, then hee was no way forſaken, which is profeſly contrary to this truth, and it is to give the good Spirit of God the lie; therefore away with thoſe imaginations, ſo that the anſwer is cleare, that God the Father did take away the ſenſe and feeling of the ſweetneſſe of his love from our Saviour; and this made him to crie out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> thus much to wipe away the cavils of the Jeſuits.

Let mee a little open both the paſſages to you: Firſt for the forſaking of our Saviour, <hi>Why hast thou forſaken mee?</hi> when he cried thus, and rored for the very diſquietneſſe of his ſoule, there was more in it than ordinarie: I will diſcover the ſubſtance of this forſaking of Chriſt how farre it went, and that in three particulars, that you may know how far to ſteere your judgements in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſenſe of the Spirit of God in this place: this forſaking of Chriſt may be conceived of in three concluſions:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it was not a totall forſaking of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but onely in part, and it was not a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall forſaking, but for a while, and it was not a taking away the Godhead from the manhood of our Saviour; but the Godhead was ever united to the manhood, and did evermore ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this forſaking was on the Fathers part, and not on our Saviours part; the Father forſakes Chriſt, but Chriſt went after him: God
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:4396:152"/>
tooke away the ſenſe of his love, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt cried after him, and laid hold upon him, and ſaith, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> the Father went away, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt went after the Father, and would not let him goe: God the Father might juſtly forſake our Saviour, being made ſinne for us by account and imputation: being our ſuretie, God the Father might juſtly take away and withdraw the ſenſe of the ſweetneſſe of his love and favour from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, without any ſinne; but now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt could not have forſaken and gone away from the Father without ſinning, ſo that this forſaking was on the Fathers part, but our Saviour held faſt, and would not be carried away, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though hee kill mee, yet will I trust in him:</hi> ſo that <hi>Iobs</hi> truſting, and Gods killing anger might ſtand together: and when the Lord wreſtled with <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Let me goe, for the day breaketh; Iacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will not let thee goe, untill thou bleſſe me.</hi> God may goe away from <hi>Iacob,</hi> but <hi>Iacob</hi> may not goe away from God for want of confidence, and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: ſo that this forſaking is to be apprehended wholly on the Fathers part, for our Saviour did not goe away from God by diffidence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt.</p>

deprived of the ſenſe of Gods favour, and the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling operation of his love and mercy that might comfort him; I ſay, it was for the while, and this ſeemes to be the reaſon of thoſe ſtrong cries, and heart-breaking complaints of his: You know when a man cries, then there is miſery, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon him; and when he cries loud, and puts forth all his powers, it implies a marvellous weight, nay, it gives us to conceive of a kinde of admiration, and a kinde of wondering with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, what the cauſe of it ſhould bee: It ſeemes here that this was the cauſe of the ſad complaint, becauſe in his agonie there were ſome inklings of Gods mercy, and now and then a ſtarre-light, and a little flaſh of lightning to cheere him: but now all the ſenſe and feeling of Gods love was gone, and not ſo much as any little ſtar-light to cheere him up; and that drives him to a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken mee?</hi> Is it poſſible that thou canſt thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thy Sonne? whats the reaſon of it? what, and an onely begotten Sonne; not that the ſpirit of conſolation was ever taken away from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, nor that the Godhead was taken away from the manhood, and ſo left comfortleſſe, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portleſſe; no, no, but howſoever the ſpirit of comfort and conſolation was there, yet the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that conſolation, wherein he had refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſolaced himſelfe, that was quite taken await.</p>

                     </label> It is a conceit for a Jeſuite, and not for a Chriſtian; for faith and the want of feeling may goe together: Chriſt longed after mercy, though hee ſaw nothing, and hee cried, <hi>my God, my God;</hi> though hee had no ſenſe of Gods love, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt faith may ſtand where no ſenſe is; <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.10. <hi>Hee that walketh in darkneſſe, and hath no light,</hi> that is, he that is altogether in miſery, and ſorrow, and anguiſh, and ſeeth no light of comfort and conſolation, what muſt hee doe? muſt hee caſt away all hope? no, let him ſtay himſelfe by the power of faith upon his God.

                  <p>The Lord in this worke of his, and in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie withdrawing himſelfe, he turnes away his face, and lookes another way, deprives him of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of the ſweetneſſe of his fellowſhip which formerly hee had: <hi>Ionah</hi> 2.4. <hi>Ionah</hi> was a good and a gratious man, though he was a ſtrange man, as one obſerves, yet when the Lord had dealt ſomething ſtrangely with him, and caſt him into the ſea, a whale receives him; and when hee was ſwallowed up of the whale, he was then ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of a greater griefe; for God had taken away the ſweetneſſe of his love from him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, <hi>I am caſt out of thy ſight,</hi> hee would play the runne away with God, and would goe to Tarſus; therefore God caſts him out of his ſight to his owne apprehenſion: therefore ſaith hee <hi>I am caſt out of thy preſence</hi> this was onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſenſe and ſweetneſſe of Gods love and favour: this you may ſee in the example of <hi>David, Pſalme</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haste, I am caſt out of thy ſight;</hi> as no queſtion but <hi>Ionah</hi> prayed in the whales belly, and ſaid, <hi>Lord pardon my ſinne, and forgive my tranſgreſsions;</hi> no, ſaith the Lord, <hi>get you downe to Tarſus:</hi> ſo <hi>David</hi> prayed, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed earneſtly ſaying, <hi>not ſmile of thy favour Lord;</hi> no, ſaith the Lord, and hee looked another way, yet <hi>thou heardeſt the voyce of my prayer:</hi> and ſo <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, yet will I looke towards thy holy Temple;</hi> hee looked to mercy whiles his eyes and his heart and all faild; ſo that faith may well ſtand, even there
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:4396:154"/>
where there is no ſenſe at all.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was here in the caſe of our Saviour, and thus the Scripture ſpeakes admirable pithily; <hi>Pſalme</hi> 77.9. <hi>Hath God forgotten to bee gracious, and hath he ſhut up his tender mercies?</hi> as if he had ſaid, though I may not have mercy, yet let me ſee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: hath God in anger ſhut up his mercy? the face of mercy is ſweet, and the preſence of mercy is comely: but hath God in anger ſhut up his tender mercies? hee hath not onely ſent him going out of doores, as hee did <hi>Ionah,</hi> but hee ſhuts himſelfe up that the poore ſinner cannot come within fight of him.</p>
                  <p>Oh ſaith the ſonne, I would my father would but looke out at the window that I might ſee him; but when hee will not ſuffer his ſonne to looke upon him, this is heavie: ſo the Lord ſaith to his ſervants, no no, you have ſlighted my kindneſſe, therefore I will locke it up, that you ſhall ſee him no more: In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the fourteenth chapter, the twentie eighth verſe; <hi>When Abſolom had dwelt two yeares in Ieruſalem, and ſaw not the Kings face,</hi> at length <hi>hee ſends for Ioab to ſend him to the King,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>either let me ſee the Kings face, or elſe wherefore doe I live?</hi> It was a great favour that hee might but ſee the Kings face; though hee might not injoy fellowſhip with him: this is a great trouble, when the Lord ſhuts up his mercy in anger: mercy hath come home to your hearts, and it hath beſought you to take it; but you have dealt baſely with the Lord, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, and this is the higheſt degree of all; the Lord doth not onely ſhut up his mercy that he cannot be ſeene, but hee goes away that a man cannot tell where to ſeeke him: Oh, ſaith the ſonne, that I might but ſee my Father, but hee is gone, and then his heart is even ſwalloweed up; nay, God doth not only take away the ſenſe and feeling of his favour beyond ſight, but hee goes away from a man, that hee cannot tell where to ſeeke him, that if he would write letters as I may ſay, yet he knowes not where to ſend them, and if he call his father, he cannot heare him: Thus the Scripture ſpeakes, and thus the ſaints of God have found it from time to time, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 77.7, 8, 9. <hi>Will the Lord abſent himſelfe for ever, and will he ſhew no more favour?</hi> this tranſlation is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble well, but the originall runs thus; <hi>will hee adde no more to bee favourable:</hi> as if hee had ſaid, what will he not only not entertaine me; but is hee gone that I cannot tell where to finde him; and in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4396:155"/>

Now that you may ſee the weight of the ſorrowes that lay upon our Saviour, conſider thus much: our Saviour was not onely caſt out of Gods favour, and God did not onely take away the ſenſe of his love, and the feeling operation of his favour, that ſo he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the ſweetneſſe that he had done; but Chriſt tooke the place of ſinners, and therefore God the Father ſhut him out amongſt ſinners, and drew his mercy out of ſight, and out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and therefore he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> Nay further, why art thou ſo farre from my helpe? Hee cried out that hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the firmament, when a little cloud growes greater and greater untill it cover the whole heaven, then we thinke it is almoſt night: ſo all the ſinnes of all the faithfull did overſpread all the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that even the ſtar-light of Gods compaſſion, and the lightning of Gods love and favour appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not.</p>

Now that this conceit of theirs is a thing marvellous inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the juſtice of God the Father, and to the wiſedome of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the death of Chriſt, I prove it thus; for by the ſame right that the dignitie of the perſon of our Saviour might abate of the puniſhment, by the ſame right the dignitie of his perſon might as well take it quite away: if one drop of the blood of Chriſt would ſave all the world, then what needed Chriſt to have ſuffered the pains of death; for if the dignitie of the perſon might free him from the one, it might free him from the other alſo, but the Law and Juſtice of God required whatſoever Chriſt did in his wiſedome ſuffer and the death of Chriſt was not ſuperfluous, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the dignitie of the perſon is to farre from freeing him from the puniſhment, that it fits him to beare the puniſhment, it exempts him not from the puniſhment, but it furniſheth him with
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:4396:160"/>
abilities to beare it: as he muſt be man, that hee may ſuffer finitely, ſo he muſt be God that muſt ſatisfie infinitely: the juſtice of God requires two things.</p>

ſilly curioſitie to inquire of Gods abſolute power what he might have done, and what he had power to doe, when we ſee what he hath done: For as hee will ſave the humble mercifully, ſo hee will preſerve his juſtice in the ſalvation of man, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.10. <hi>The will of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> and <hi>Pſalme</hi> 40.8. <hi>I deſire to doe thy will, oh my God:</hi> It is the will of God that Chriſt ſhould come and ſhould ſuffer for our ſinnes; he hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what his will is, and it is folly to inquire what God might doe, when we ſee what he hath done: and beſides, this I take to bee an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting truth, that none of all the attributes of God can ever enterfeere or croſſe one another, it cannot be, for then God ſhould not procure nor main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his owne glory, for when hee ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the glory of his juſtice, hee ſhould wrong the glory of his mercy, and when he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the glory of his mercy, hee ſhould wrong the glory of his juſtice; and the glory of his juſtice muſt bee preſerved as well as the glory of his mercy magnified; the mercy of God cannot wrong juſtice, nor the juſtice of God cannot overpower mercy: therefore hence I infer thus much; if there were no means in the world whereby the juſtice of God (which had received wrong) could be ſatisfied, but only by the ſufferings of him who was God and man; then it was againſt the will of God, and againſt the will of Chriſt which was both God and man, and againſt their glory and dignitie to deviſe another way or means to pardon ſinne without

the ſatisfaction of divine juſtice, it is againſt his glory power, and wiſedome, to wrong either ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or mercy, for he ſhould either have wronged mercy in not pardoning, or elſe wronged juſtice in not puniſhing of Chriſt; therefore if there ſhould be no way to doe it, but only by the death of him who was both God and man, then there was no other way of redemption but this way, for an infinite juſtice being wronged, there is no way elſe to ſatisfie an infinite juſtice, but by the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him who was infinite, and that was onely the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for there was no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites in the world.</p>

A Phyſitian cuts a man, and an enemy ſtabs a man, the knife was all alike; but to the one, it comes from a friend, and to the other it comes from an enemy: ſo God doth ſend afflictions to the godly, and to him they

                  <p>Secondly, all the puniſhments and corrections that come upon the godly, the Lord ſo orders, and tempers, and ſweetens them by his ſaving graces, and by the worke of his Spirit, that they all worke and turne to their good, the love of God is ſo farre ſhed abroad into their hearts by the power of Chriſts merits, and ſo ſhewed therein, that they procure good and comfort to their ſoules for ever; but in the puniſhments and curſes of the wicked, they come from under the croſſe more hardned, and more blinded, and more fierce and rebellious againſt God and his grace; but the godly come from under the croſſe more holy, and more meeke, and more patient, and reformed in their lives and converſations: as it is with the poyſon that is taken in hand by a skillfull Phyſitian, hee knowes the nature of it, and knowes how to correct it, and to take away the malignant qualitie of it, either of the cold, or of the heat: ſo afflictions of themſelves are plagues, and judgements, and they are able to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:4396:164"/>
harden the heart, and to blinde the minde: this is that <hi>Ahaz,</hi> ſaith the text, even wicked <hi>Ahaz;</hi> this is the puniſhment and poyſon of the wicked; and it bringeth puniſhment upon them; it blinds their mindes, and hardens their hearts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whenſoever a wicked man doth come forth from under the curſe, he is farre worſe than hee was before, his heart more dead and more fierce, and hee walkes more rebelliouſly againſt God and his grace; but when they are laid upon the people of God, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt takes away the malignant qualitie of them, and all the poyſon of puniſhment and povertie, and takes away all the venome of ſickneſſe and diſgrace, and it is now a preſervative, and it is good to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, and to have the poyſon thus corrected, and to humble him, and to purge him, and to doe him good in his latter end; they are the ſame in nature, that they are unto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but the difference is in the qualitie of them: therefore the concluſion is thus much; That all afflictions come from the hand of a loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the godly, and though they come in anger to their ſinnes, yet they worke for their good and ſalvation.</p>

A wife would rather bee a trouble, than a helpe, but that the blood of Chriſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her: therefore I ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let him bee Anathema, Maranatha:</hi> aske your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours if they love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Let that ſoule bee accurſed untill the comming of Chriſt to judgement: Curſe him all yee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

in Heaven, and all yee Devils in Hell: Curſe him all yee creatures, and let this curſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine upon him untill the comming of Chriſt unto judgement, and let theſe curſes bee ſealed downe upon him for ever, and when you are come to the end of all, this will bee the plague and the curſe of all, that you had Chriſt and mercy ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to you once, and you would not receive it: therefore ſince Chriſt hath thought nothing too good for us, even his life and blood, and was content to part with the ſenſe and feeling of the ſweetneſſe of the love of God the Father, thinke nothing too good for Chriſt, but love him in all things, and by all means; the Lord grant wee may.</p>
